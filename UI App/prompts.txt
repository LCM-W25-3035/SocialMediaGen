Prompts:

1. 22 march 2025:
* Start: I am creating a django app to create a social media post using news headline and summary.

* last prompt: 
try {
      const newsId = "{{ news_item.id}}";  // Use the correct variable for the news item ID (can be removed if using headline) 
      if (!newsId) {
          throw new Error('News ID not found.');
      }

correct this part for me as it is still taking news_id not headline


2. 30 March 2025:
* Start: at the output section I want only post generated data, not the prompt given by user and news details

* last prompt: for output also check for 'Additional user instructions:' if present, show news after that
