      "Summary: • Trump’s agenda: President Donald Trump is forging ahead with his plans to remake the US government, facing mounting legal challenges as he purges the federal workforce. The new administration’s first Supreme Court appeal will center on Trump’s firing of a government ethics watchdog, which was halted by a lower court. • Wartime diplomacy: Top Trump officials will meet with Russian counterparts for Ukraine peace talks in the coming days, as concern grows in Kyiv and across Europe about the administration’s approach to ending Russia’s war. Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel today, arriving at the same time as new heavy bombs from the US. • Party moves: Democrats are still without an obvious leader and grappling with shock and bickering over how to counter Trump’s presidency, with a mid-March government budget deadline looming as a potential inflection point. Meanwhile, GOP-led states have moved to mirror the president’s agenda. Talks between the US and Russia over the war in Ukraine are set to begin Tuesday, multiple sources told CNN. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and national security adviser Mike Waltz are all traveling to Saudi Arabia for the talks, CNN previously reported. A Saudi official told CNN the Saudi team will be involved in a mediation role. The team will be led by their national security adviser. A Ukrainian official confirmed they will not be present at the talks, though Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s Russia-Ukraine envoy, discussed a “dual track” set of negotiations and will be in Kyiv this week. President Donald Trump also said Sunday that the Ukrainians will be part of the negotiations. Some background: Trump has talked openly about the Saudis playing a key role in the negotiations, and the country has been an important part of US foreign policy under his presidency. It was just a week ago that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman helped facilitate the release of detained American Marc Fogel in Russia. Trump’s first foreign trip of his first term was to Saudi Arabia in 2017. CNN’s Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting to this post. The Department of Education sent a “Dear Colleague” letter Friday threatening the federal funding of any academic institution that considers race in most aspects of student life. The letter, geared toward all preschool, elementary, secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, as well as state educational agencies that receive financial assistance from the federal government, stated a sweeping and controversial interpretation of federal law following the 2023 Supreme Court decision Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which gutted affirmative action. The instructions are almost certain to draw legal challenges. This interpretation could open a wide range of challenges to courses and literature taught in schools, scholarships for non-White students, and various student organizations including Black fraternities and sororities. “And race-based decision-making, no matter the form, remains impermissible. For example, a school may not use students’ personal essays, writing samples, participation in extracurriculars, or other cues as a means of determining or predicting a student’s race and favoring or disfavoring such students,” the letter reads. The letter also criticized diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, known as DEI, claiming, “Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices.” The letter says the department will “take appropriate measures to assess compliance with the applicable statutes and regulations based on the understanding embodied in this letter” no later than February 28, “including antidiscrimination requirements that are a condition of receiving federal funding.” President Donald Trump says Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky will be involved in the peace negotiations on Russia’s war in Ukraine. The US president could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin “very soon,” he added, as he took questions from reporters in West Palm Beach on Sunday. Asked if Zelensky would be involved in the conversations, Trump said, “He will be involved — yes.” Some context: Trump said earlier this week that negotiations to end the nearly three-year Ukraine war will start “immediately” after holding a “lengthy and highly productive” phone call with Putin. His administration has since sent top delegates to Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian counterparts. Trump’s posture toward Putin — and comments from administration officials about concessions Ukraine may need to make to secure peace — has prompted concern in Kyiv and across Europe that Ukrainian and European leaders will be frozen out of the talks. On tariffs: Trump was also asked by reporters about European countries saying they will ban US food imports in response to his tariffs. “I don’t mind. Let them do it. Let them do it,” Trump said. “They’re just hurting themselves if they do that. I can’t imagine it, but doesn’t matter.” President Donald Trump will ask the Supreme Court to allow him to fire the head of a government ethics watchdog agency in the first appeal from his litigious second term to reach the nation’s highest court. At the center of the appeal is Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel and whom Trump fired this month despite protections enacted by Congress, which require an administration to show cause for dismissing someone from the post before their five-year term has ended. A federal district court temporarily blocked Dellinger’s dismissal while it considers his case, and the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit late Saturday declined to overrule that decision. The Justice Department prepared its appeal to the Supreme Court within hours of that decision. The Justice Department described the district court’s ruling as an “unprecedented assault on the separation of powers,” according to a copy of the appeal obtained by CNN. Catch up on the case here. President Donald Trump announced his nominations to head the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the US attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and a new adviser to help run the National Archives in a series of social media posts Sunday. In another post, Trump said he is nominating Judge Jason Reding Quiñones to serve as US attorney for the Southern District of Florida to “restore Law and Order, prosecute violent crimes and, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.” Trump also announced a new senior adviser, Jim Byron, to help run the National Archives and Records Administration, shortly after the administration forced out senior leadership at the institution in a major shakeup last week. Trump has been highly critical of the archives since the agency asked the Department of Justice to investigate Trump’s mishandling of classified documents after he left office. President Donald Trump is attending the Daytona 500, NASCAR’s premiere race in Daytona, Florida, on Sunday. The presidential limousine, known colloquially as “The Beast,” did ceremonial pace laps around the track before the race started shortly after 2 p.m. ET. The president addressed the drivers over the radio during his pace laps, saying he’s a “big fan” and wishing them a good race. He later told the Fox broadcast “there’s spirit again” in the country and around the world. Earlier today, Trump released a statement that said the event “showcases the fastest, most fearless drivers in motorsports, who represent our Nation’s love of tradition, competition, and automotive innovation.” This year’s Daytona 500 features 41 drivers racing for 500 miles to win NASCAR’s largest purse. Trump’s race appearance comes shortly after he made history as the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl. This post has been updated with details about Trump’s appearance at the race. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he knew about US President Donald Trump’s vision for a US takeover of Gaza before it was announced. In a cabinet meeting on Sunday speaking about US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Israel, Netanyahu said, “We have a shared strategy, we are coordinated, and we are working in full cooperation. This has been happening even before President Trump published his vision for Gaza, a revolutionary vision, which holds enormous change for the state of Israel.” Remember: At a joint news conference alongside Netanyahu earlier this month, Trump announced an idea for the US to “take over” Gaza, relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries, and redevelop the war-torn enclave into what he described as the “Riviera of the Middle East.” It was an unprecedented proposal for a sitting US president to float publicly, and prompted swift backlash from the leaders of Arab countries and across the world. The Israeli leader had previously referred to Trump’s idea as a “revolutionary, creative vision.” Multiple top prosecutors appointed by former President Joe Biden to federal districts across the country were left without official means to communicate Friday after their government-issued phones and email accounts were deactivated, two sources familiar with the move tell CNN. The United States attorneys were provided no explanation why their electronic communications suddenly stopped working, sources said, and as of Sunday they still had not received a response from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General seeking details. The disruption in electronic communication experienced by several of the nation’s senior prosecutors was first reported by Bloomberg. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. It is unclear how many prosecutors were specifically impacted, but nearly two dozen US attorneys appointed by Biden are believed to still be on the job. Why this matters: While it is not unusual for an incoming administration to replace chief prosecutors, who serve as Senate-confirmed political appointees, the sudden inability of US attorneys still serving to communicate presents a potential threat to public safety, sources said. In addition to managing the daily functions of their respective offices, US attorneys are key players in the government’s response to urgent national security incidents such as a terrorist attack, where their approval may be needed in order for investigators to seek emergency court authorizations. The disruption in official communication services Friday set off a scramble by those impacted to ensure their staff and law enforcement partner agencies had alternate personal phone and email information in the event of an emergency, sources said. President Donald Trump’s administration is working on a plan to combat avian flu as Americans face sparse supply and high prices for eggs at grocery stores across the country. Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, told CBS on Sunday that he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins will present Trump with a plan next week. Hassett blamed egg supply issues on the Biden administration’s strategy of killing chickens to mitigate the spread of avian flu. Hassett said the goal is a “smarter” method that would avoid killing the chickens by using biosecurity measures and medication to ensure safety. “We’re finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government,” he said on “Face the Nation.” Key context: While agricultural experts say politicians in Washington and around the country can do more to help curtail avian flu, they largely agree the egg shortage is not former President Joe Biden’s fault. It’s not Trump’s, either, but the president has now inherited the issue after campaigning on promises to immediately bring down prices, particularly at the grocery store. The US’ approach to bird flu has long focused on eradication. However, that strategy may be shifting as the virus spreads to other types of animals and becomes harder to contain. Last week, the USDA gave conditional approval to a bird flu vaccine for use in chickens, according to the vaccine’s maker, Zoetis. Several countries already vaccinate chickens against bird flu. Americans can continue to expect high prices for eggs over the course of this year, new estimates show. CNN’s Jamie Gumbrecht and Vanessa Yurkevich contributed to this report. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says there is bipartisan support in Congress for Ukraine, despite what she called a “mixed message” coming from the Trump administration. In an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Shaheen called out seemingly contradictory statements in recent days by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top administration officials regarding whether it’s realistic for Ukraine to join NATO or ever return to its pre-2014 borders. Shaheen praised Senate Armed Services Commitee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, for telling Politico he was “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments making concessions about the future of Ukraine. Shaheen said there is a “great deal of concern” among allies at the conference about the “US position on Ukraine,” and highlighted how lawmakers assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky there is “no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies” in holding Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable through sanctions. Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, is playing a central role in the Trump administration’s approach to securing peace in both Gaza and Ukraine. Here’s what he said today on each front: Gaza ceasefire: Witkoff expressed confidence that phase two of the uneasy ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas would take place. “Phase two is absolutely going to begin,” he said during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” noting that he spoke by phone today with leaders in Israel, Qatar and Egypt. Phase two of the ceasefire would include the return of 19 Israel Defense Forces soldiers, whom the US believes to be alive, as well as others, including American citizen Edan Alexander. In a statement today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio applauded the release of three more hostages by Hamas on Saturday, but warned the group’s leaders that they are “playing with fire” as negotiations continue over the release of their remaining captives. Rubio called on Hamas to release remaining hostages immediately. Ukraine war negotiations: Witkoff told Bartiromo he’s traveling with a US delegation to Saudi Arabia on Sunday to begin talks with senior Moscow officials aimed at ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, as CNN has previously reported. He described the upcoming negotiations as “trust-building” toward the ultimate goal of ending the war. Witkoff disputed criticism that Ukraine isn’t part of the Saudi Arabia talks, pointing to President Donald Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other high-level Trump officials’ engagement with Ukrainian officials. “I don’t think this is about excluding anybody. In fact, it’s about including everybody,” Witkoff said. CNN’s Alison Main contributed reporting to this post. Plans for President Donald Trump’s team to meet with senior Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days mark the first steps in a process to determine whether Russia is serious about ending its war in Ukraine, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday. Pressed on whom he would be meeting, Rubio said, “Nothing’s been finalized yet.” CNN has reported that the Kremlin is assembling a group of top political, economic and intelligence personnel to participate in the talks. Rubio indicated both Ukraine and European leaders would be brought into the negotiations if talks progress in the right direction — comments that come a day after the US special envoy on the conflict, Keith Kellogg, said Europe would not have a seat at the table. That fanned fears in Ukraine and across the continent about the new US approach to peace talks. The secretary of state also provided some details about his call yesterday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, which, Rubio said, was meant to establish an open channel of communication. Rubio said he raised the issue of the “very difficult conditions” diplomats are operating under at the US embassy in Moscow. Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin said Sunday that Ukraine should be at the negotiating table for peace talks along with Russia and the United States. When pressed on the fact that Ukraine is not being included in upcoming talks between the Trump administration and Russia in Saudi Arabia — and was not even informed of the negotiations, according to a Ukrainian source — Mullin praised Trump for having separate discussions with both parties. He said the president’s goal was “getting them in separate rooms, talking about what they will accept, and then finding out a negotiation path forward before you bring them to the table,” because bringing the two sides directly together too fast could lead to significant setbacks. The Oklahoma lawmaker said he has not had conversations with President Donald Trump or Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker about whether the US will continue to supply weapons to Ukraine until there is a ceasefire. Democrats are still at the negotiating table with Republicans as the March 14 deadline to fund the government looms, but the party will make sure the GOP shoulders the blame of a potential shutdown, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Sunday. “Republicans have consistently shut down the government in the past, and it would be no surprise if they do just that,” Jeffries said on ABC’s “This Week.” Jeffries said Democrats are looking for a spending agreement that “meets the needs of the American people in terms of their health, their safety, our national security and certainly the economic well-being of everyday Americans.” He said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top House Democratic appropriator, has been in “off and on conversations” with GOP House colleagues, as well as senators, adding, “We’ll see how that unfolds over the next few weeks.” Jeffries said he has not spoken with anyone in the Trump administration on the issue, but he expects conversations across the aisle to “intensify” as the funding deadline approaches. He also called a GOP-led plan to advance President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda, which passed along party lines in the House Budget Committee on Thursday, “out of control” and a “non-starter.” US national security adviser Mike Waltz previewed the key tenets that he said will drive peace talks in the coming days between top Trump administration figures and senior Russian officials to end the war in Ukraine. Waltz said on “Fox News Sunday” that the “key underpinnings” the US will emphasize include securing a permanent end to the war, which “can’t be ended on the battlefield,” a change in how the US distributes foreign aid, and the integration of Ukraine financially with the US. On the last point, Waltz argued being “coinvested” with the US was the best route to Ukraine’s security, pointing to an investment deal handed to Ukraine by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not sign. “Zelensky would be very wise to enter into this agreement with the United States,” Waltz said. “We’re talking about growing the pie for the Ukrainian economy.” Meanwhile, Waltz said long-term military security guarantees for the country need to be “European-led.” Key context: President Donald Trump and his administration have presented a vision for ending the war that appears to allow for key concessions to Russia, raising fears that Ukraine could be marginalized and Europe left out of peacemaking. Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff are planning to travel to Saudi Arabia for the talks with Russia, two sources familiar with the plans previously told CNN. Ukraine was “not informed” about the delegation’s plans, a Ukrainian official told CNN. Zelensky has previously said the country will not accept a peace deal struck between the US and Russia without Kyiv’s involvement. Europe’s role: Waltz said European allies have been engaged in conversations around the Russia-Ukraine conflict. He said Trump spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron this week, and announced an upcoming meeting between Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Élysée confirmed Trump’s conversation with the French president, but did not provide details. CNN has also reached out to the White House National Security Council. Trump administration border czar Tom Homan called it “ridiculous” to suggest New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ decision to let federal immigration agents into Rikers Island was related to the Department of Justice ordering federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against Adams. The concession came after a second meeting, following the charges being dropped, but Homan said it was just the two men talking “cop to cop.” “That’s why I requested a second meeting, to find out what more we need to do, get some of this stuff in place. So I just think, you know, people making a lot about nothing,” he said. Key context: The DOJ’s dismissal “without prejudice” leaves open the possibility of reinstating the charges against Adams. The lead prosecutor on the case, Hagan Scotten, was among those who resigned over the move. He called the action a “dismissal-with-leverage,” and warned in a resignation letter against using “prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials.” Homan on AOC: Homan also said he wants the DOJ to review the definition of “impeding” law enforcement after Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York held a webinar advising people of their legal rights when interacting with ICE. Advising people of their legal rights is not a crime, nor is exercising those legal rights. It is also not legally considered impeding law enforcement to do either. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Sunday that she doesn’t believe the Trump administration’s defiance of court orders has risen to the level of a constitutional crisis, but warned that officials could face legal consequences if they hold firm in ignoring judges. “We’re not quite there yet,” Klobuchar told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” adding that Trump administration officials, including “lower level people,” will have to decide if they’re prepared to face contempt of court charges. The senator said that, ultimately, Trump’s first administration did follow court orders, and that some of her Republican colleagues, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Sens. Chuck Grassley and Josh Hawley, have been voices saying, “You have to follow the rule of law.” NY corruption case: Responding to the Justice Department’s push for prosecutors to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused the administration of using the mayor as a “political pawn.” Potential government shutdown: Asked by Bash if she thinks Democrats should withhold votes from a bill to fund the government beyond March 14 as leverage, Klobuchar argued her party doesn’t want a shutdown, but it is up to Republicans to prevent that from happening, suggesting Democrats are not eager to come to the table in negotiations. Well, that was another very busy week in US politics. It wasn’t easy to keep track of everything going on both in the US and abroad, so if you’re joining us this Sunday, here are some of the key things you should know from the week that was. In the courts: Judges have issued a cascade of rulings in recent days pausing various actions from President Donald Trump’s effort to vastly shrink and reshape the federal government. The legal battles have centered on issues including the Department of Government Efficiency’s access to sensitive federal data systems, attempts to unilaterally freeze billions of dollars in federal funding, and moves to defund transgender healthcare. Internationally: Perhaps one of the biggest lines this week was Trump revealing his plan to hold peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. The call took Ukraine, and Europe, by surprise and sparked panic across the continent, which played out at this weekend’s Munich Security Conference. Now on the outside looking in, European leaders will hold an emergency summit regarding the war on Monday. Of chief concern: Trump has suggested it would be “unlikely” that Ukraine would get much of its occupied land back as a part of the deal. Separately, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel today to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the country’s multi-front conflicts and resisting Iran. It comes at the same time as newly released heavy bombs arrive in Israel from the US. The Biden administration had previously restricted the heavy munitions out of fear they could be used indiscriminately in Gaza. DOJ resignations over Adams case: From Thursday evening to Saturday morning, seven prosecutors in New York and Washington — including top career prosecutors overseeing public corruption cases — resigned instead of complying with orders from the Trump administration to dismiss a corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Adams is now under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and political opponents, who say the dismissal could make the mayor beholden to the Trump administration. Ukraine was “not informed” about the US delegation due to head to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russia on ending the war, a Ukrainian official told CNN. National security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to travel to Saudi Arabia for the meeting with senior Russian officials, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN. Some context: This week, US President Donald Trump suggested it was “unlikely” Ukraine would get back much of its occupied land in the peace negotiations he intends to hold with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump’s comment came after he held a 90-minute phone call with Putin on Wednesday, and it sparked panic across Europe and Ukraine. Top Trump administration officials are set to meet with senior Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine, a source told CNN on Saturday. National security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to attend, according to two sources familiar with the plans. The sources declined to say which Russian officials would be in attendance, but CNN has previously reported the Kremlin is assembling a high-level negotiating team to engage in direct talks with the US, including top-level political, intelligence and economic figures. How we got here: President Donald Trump said earlier this week that negotiations to end the nearly three-year Ukraine war will start “immediately” after holding a “lengthy and highly productive” phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The call, which was the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end. Zelensky’s concerns: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky warned at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that the days of guaranteed US support for Europe are over. “The old days are over — when America supported Europe just because it always had,” he added. Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on stage at the security conference, Zelensky conceded that he was “not happy” that Trump’s first call was with Putin. The Ukrainian leader warned it would be even “more dangerous” however if Trump meets with the Russian president before him. Ukrainians tell CNN they are fearful any Trump-brokered ceasefire will be full of concessions to Russia and false promises. European leaders on the outside looking in: Zelensky’s warning came just hours before Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s Russia-Ukraine envoy, told the same conference that European negotiators would not be at the table for peace talks. The Europeans’ positions would be taken into consideration, Kellogg said, adding that that’s one of the reasons he’s in Munich. But they won’t be participants, the retired US general said. The Trump-Putin phone call has been viewed as a potential turning point in US-European relations. A shipment of heavy bombs from the United States has arrived in Israel, as Marco Rubio visits the country on his first official trip to the region since becoming US secretary of state. The munitions were sent after President Donald Trump’s administration last month lifted a hold on the deliveries, Israel’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday. The release of the heavy bomb shipments rolled back one of the few Biden-era policies meant to exert leverage on Israel during its war in Gaza. Former President Joe Biden had restricted the delivery of the 2,000-pound bombs out of concern they could be used indiscriminately by Israel’s military in densely populated areas of Gaza. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the shipment of MK-84 munitions “represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States,” in a statement from his ministry. The head of Gaza’s Government Media Office Salama Maroof criticized the US decision. Rubio landed in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, where he was greeted by Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. He is meeting with Netanyahu at his office in Jerusalem Sunday morning, where Trump’s controversial proposal to “take over” the Gaza Strip is likely to come under discussion. Read more about Rubio’s visit here. In less than a month in office, the Trump administration has simultaneously dismantled foreign aid programs that support fragile democracies abroad and put on leave federal workers who protect US elections at home in a move that current and former officials say abandons decades of American commitments to democracy. USAID, the main foreign aid agency, and the State Department have halted funding for democracy and human rights-focused programs. The State Department has also laid off about five-dozen contractors focused on those issues, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The Department of Homeland Security this month put on leave several employees who have worked to protect election systems from security threats at home, including advisers who work in red states on basic, nonpartisan cybersecurity measures. On Friday night, the department told employees it was pausing all of its election security work, pending a review. (Wired first reported on that move.) The damage to democracies around the world from the foreign aid cuts will be felt for years, current and former US officials told CNN. Read more about the fallout from the moves here.\n",

      "Summary: “Saturday Night Live” is celebrating its big 50th anniversary milestone in a way that only the long-running sketch show can: with a very star-studded special. “SNL50: The Anniversary Special” is set to air this Sunday with favorite “SNL” alums like Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy and Kate McKinnon, among many others. Paul McCartney is the featured musical guest, while Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter and other artists are also tapped to appear on the special. Here’s everything you need to know about how to tune in to this three-hour birthday celebration for NBC’s most beloved live comedy sketch show: The “Anniversary Special” will air live on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on NBC and will be simulcast on Peacock. The three-hour show will take place at the famed Studio 8H stage in New York City’s Rockefeller Center, where “SNL” has been broadcast since 1975. YouTube star and “Chicken Shop Date” host Amelia Dimoldenberg has been tapped to serve as the correspondent for the official red carpet for the “Anniversary Special.” The carpet will be livestreamed on Instagram, TikTok, X, Facebook and YouTube on Sunday at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT. The special will feature a star-studded lineup of former “SNL” cast members and celebrities who’ve both hosted, appeared on and performed on the sketch show throughout its decades-long history. NBC has so far announced the following famous faces will be making an appearance: Adam Sandler, Amy Poehler, Andy Samberg, Chevy Chase, Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy, Fred Armisen, Garrett Morris, Jane Curtin, Jason Sudeikis, Jimmy Fallon, Kate McKinnon, Kenan Thompson, Kristen Wiig, Laraine Newman, Maya Rudolph, Molly Shannon, Pete Davidson, Seth Meyers, Tina Fey, Tracy Morgan, Will Ferrell, Will Forte and more.

One person who won’t appear on the special is “SNL” alum Bill Hader, who many noticed was notably left off the list of those set to participate. A rep for Hader told CNN this week that the actor has a “longstanding schedule conflict.” There will certainly be no shortage of musical moments. On Friday morning, the official Instagram for “SNL” announced that the Anniversary Special will feature performances by Paul McCartney, Sabrina Carpenter, Miley Cyrus, Brittany Howard, Paul Simon, Lil Wayne and the Roots. On Friday, Peacock livestreamed a starry concert from Radio City Music Hall hosted by former “SNL” cast member Jimmy Fallon. “SNL50: The Homecoming Concert,” which was being produced by “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels and Mark Ronson, featured live performances by Arcade Fire, Backstreet Boys, Bad Bunny, Bonnie Raitt, Brandi Carlile, Brittany Howard, Chris Martin, David Byrne, DEVO, Eddie Vedder, Jack White, Jelly Roll, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Mumford & Sons, Post Malone, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Robyn, The B-52s, The Roots and more. Several “SNL50” specials have previously been released as the show continues to mark its 50th anniversary milestone throughout the season. Peacock released a three-hour documentary last month titled Ladies & Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music,” which was produced by Questlove and chronicled some of the show’s most memorable musical moments and performances. A four-part docuseries titled “SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night” is also currently available to stream on Peacock. It features a behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of the show through interviews with former writers, producers and cast members, including Michaels.\n",

      "Headline: Netanyahu\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/middleeast/heavy-bombs-israel-rubio-visit-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Sunday to “finish the job” against Iran with the support of US President Donald Trump. Netanyahu was speaking alongside US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is visiting Israel in his first official trip to the region since assuming the role. “Over the last 16 months, Israel has dealt a mighty blow to Iran’s terror axis. Under the strong leadership of President Trump… I have no doubt that we can and will finish the job,” Netanyahu said. Rubio said that there “could never be a nuclear Iran.” “It’s important to constantly point that whether we talk about Hamas or we talk about Hezbollah, we talk about violence in the West Bank, or we talk about destabilization in Syria, or we talk about any of these issues the militias in Iraq, they all have behind them one common theme – Iran,” Rubio added. “That must be addressed,” he added. US intelligence agencies recently warned both the Biden and Trump administrations that Israel will likely attempt to strike facilities key to Iran’s nuclear program this year, according to sources familiar with the assessments. Israel’s willingness to use military force runs counter to President Donald Trump’s current desire for a peace deal with Tehran, and the recent US intelligence cautions that major strikes on Iranian nuclear sites could increase the risk of a wider war breaking out in the Middle East. Overall, Israel is also still pursuing the broader goal of causing regime change in Iran, one of the recent US intelligence reports says. The Israeli leader said he has a common strategy with Trump on Gaza and its future, vowing to open the “gates of hell” if all hostages are not released. Trump this month proposed the US taking ownership of Gaza and moving Palestinians out of the devastated strip permanently, triggering a storm of protest. “It may have shocked and surprised many,” Rubio said in reference to the plan, “but what cannot continue is the same cycle where we repeat over and over again and wind up in the exact same place.” Netanyahu said on Sunday he knew about the plan before the US president announced it. “This didn’t come as a surprise, we knew about it and discussed it beforehand,” the Israeli prime minister said. Speaking to leaders of American Jewish organizations, Netanyahu said the plan was “the only viable plan to enable a different future for the people of Gaza, for Israel, and for the region.” Rubio’s trip coincided with the US sending a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel. The munitions were sent after Trump’s administration last month lifted a hold on the deliveries, Israel’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday. Israel’s defense minister Israel Katz said the shipment of MK-84 munitions “represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States,” in a statement from his ministry. Katz thanked Trump and the US administration for their “unwavering support.” The new administration’s release of the heavy bomb shipments rolled back one of the few Biden-era policies meant to exert leverage on Israel during its war in Gaza. Former President Joe Biden had restricted the delivery of the 2,000-pound bombs out of concern they could be used indiscriminately by Israel’s military in densely populated areas of Gaza. Despite causing tensions between Biden and Netanyahu, the move did not portend any major changes in the war. Nor did it significantly improve Biden’s standing among critics of the war, who argued for significantly tighter restrictions on American arms sales to Israel. The head of Gaza’s Government Media Office Salama Maroof criticized the US decision to send the heavy bombs. “Instead of sending food, medicine, water, or shelter and building materials to the victims in the Gaza Strip, even with a humanitarian motive, the United States of America, the first democracy in the world and a pioneer of human rights, as it describes itself, supports the criminal occupation army with 1,800 heavy MK bombs,” Maroof said. Rubio landed in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, where he was greeted by Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on the first leg of his trip to the region. He met with Netanyahu at his office in Jerusalem Sunday morning. It comes a day after three Israeli hostages were released by Hamas as part of a US-mediated ceasefire agreement, although the fragile nature of the truce was underlined again Sunday when Hamas said an Israeli strike killed three police officers in Gaza, in what it called a “serious violation.” And amid uncertainty about the future of the deal, Netanyahu’s office said he would discuss its second phase with his political-security cabinet on Monday. Meanwhile, an Israeli delegation will go to Cairo Monday for discussions on phase one of the deal. After a phone call with Netanyahu and top officials from Egypt and Qatar – the other mediating countries – US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Sunday that he was confident phase two of the deal would take place. Phase two of the ceasefire would include the return of 19 Israel Defense Forces soldiers, whom the US believes to be alive, as well as others, including American citizen Edan Alexander. Before his meeting with Netanyahu, Secretary Rubio attended mass at the historic Church of the Holy Sepulchre, according to a State Department official.\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/us/hurricane-helene-mules-struck-down-on-road/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Among the idyllic landscapes of Mount Ulla, North Carolina, there is a sadness wafting through the community where two mules and a horse that carried supplies to victims of Hurricane Helene were hit and killed last weekend. The three animals, named Vader, Kev, and Amigo, were struck by a semitruck on a road. A tree fell on a fence, leaving an opening for the three faithful equines to escape their pasture, according to a post on the Mountain Mule Packer Ranch Facebook page. “We could not be more heartbroken over this incredible loss, and it is with great pain that we share it with you, as we know many of you have also fallen in love with these sweet animals,” the ranch said in the post. The packs of mules trekked through treacherous roadways and rocky mountain sides to deliver food, water and building supplies to those devastated by the hurricane. The mules helped deliver disaster relief from western North Carolina to eastern Tennessee, the ranch said on social media. The organization’s mission is to provide mule training and packing instruction for civilian and military groups. The animals are equipped to carry gear and resources for weapon groups, communication teams and medical teams in remote environments, according to the ranch. The hard work of these mules and their tireless efforts united the community after the tragedy of Hurricane Helene, Mountain Mule Packers’ co-founder Michele Toberer said. Since the devastating cyclone hit Appalachia in September, the mules have played an integral part in relief efforts, especially in areas inaccessible by vehicles, the animals’ owner said. Hurricane Helene was a Category 4 storm that created a 500-mile path of destruction from Florida to North Carolina with catastrophic flooding, damaging winds and power outages. Helene is one of the costliest tropical cyclones to ever hit the United States, resulting in nearly $80 billion in damage. At least 106 people were killed as a result of the storm, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. In November, the ranch created a Christian non-profit disaster response organization known as Mission Mules to continue hurricane relief. The community was unified by their work in a beautiful way, Toberer explained. “They brought more than just supplies to people. It’s that they were bringing hope to people, because there were so many people that felt like they were forgotten,” Toberer said. “Just the fact that these mules were coming brought a smile to their face.” Despite this tragic loss, the disaster relief organization pushes forward with its mission. The team and its mules are hosting a distribution event in Black Mountain, North Carolina for those continuing to be impacted by Helene’s aftermath. “The thought of leaving on Saturday without the other three is already heartbreaking for us, so we’re preparing ourselves for that,” Toberer said. “Their work ethic and what they’ve done with the people in western North Carolina taught us in the last few months that when something unimaginable happens, we still keep going.”\n",

      "Headline: Coca-Cola\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/business/coca-cola-fairlife-milk/index.html\n",
      "Summary: When James Quincey became CEO of Coca-Cola in 2017, soda had broadly been in decline over its health effects. The beverage giant was embarking on an effort to diversify its reach beyond the sugary drink. A key move? Ditching the carbonation and sticking to the basics: cow milk. Launched in 2012, Fairlife — originally founded as a joint venture between Coca-Cola and wholesale dairy producer Select Milk Producers — used whimsical, minimalistic packaging that fits with the influx of niche almond, protein and even pistachio milks, outperforming large-container beverages in the dairy aisle. In 2020, Coca-Cola fully acquired Fairlife for an initial $980 million — an acquisition that has far exceeded the soda giant’s expectations due in part to social media popularity in the health and wellness space. While Americans face higher food prices and a pullback in their spending, they’re still drawn to Fairlife’s ultra-filtered system that draws out lactose and sugar but doubles the protein. In 2022, Coca-Cola announced that Fairlife’s sales surpassed $1 billion. The success is driven by Fairlife’s Core Power protein shake brand, which remains a popular staple at many grocery stores and does not have many direct market-leading competitors. But in its latest earnings call last week, Coca-Cola projected some moderation of Fairlife’s growth in 2025 while it builds a facility in New York and carbonated beverages still make up the overwhelming majority of sales for Coca-Cola (its competitor, Pepsi, on the other hand, leans on its Frito-Lay snack brand). And when compared to Coca-Cola’s other big acquisition in the non-soda space — Costa Coffee in 2018 — Fairlife has far outpaced it. “The expectations were never for Fairlife to be this successful, I think even for Coke,” said Kaumil Gajrawala, an analyst for finance firm Jeffries. The acquisition was structured so there would be an earn-out — meaning the amount paid will ultimately be based on the milk brand’s success. In deals like this, the buyer could pay less than buying outright if they’re not sure a product will be successful, Gajrawala said. The total payment for the acquisition is now looking to be $6.2 billion, plus the $980 million Coke initially paid, according to Coca-Cola’s latest earnings report. That would make it among Coke’s priciest acquisitions to date. “Dairy has been tricky for Coke to get into,” Gajrawala said. “Nothing will ever be as important as a Coke trademark, but this is a nice contributor to growth.” The North American market has shown it will invest in health, whether it’s Vital Farms’ free-range eggs or Fairlife’s protein-dense milk. Coca-Cola entered the right category at the right time, Citi analyst Filippo Falorni told CNN. “You had a more health-conscious consumer in the United States, and particularly with a bigger focus on protein intake over the last couple of years,” Falorni said. Protein shakes are a $6 billion market, according to Beverage Digest, a global non-alcoholic beverage industry trade publication. Grocery items in the middle-priced range are often what Americans decide to stop buying, Gajrawala said. Consumers are either looking for the lowest-priced product or are willing to pay a lot more for something that’s differentiated. Fairlife, with its successful branding, has managed to pull off the latter, Gajrawala said. And it also benefits from Coca-Cola’s behemoth distribution system, which Falorni said is arguably the best in the world. TikTok users frequently post themselves drinking Core Power before a workout or making a healthier morning iced coffee using Fairlife’s milk. But just as quickly as items go viral on social media, they can also fall out of trend, especially in the health and wellness space. Additionally, in 2022, Fairlife and Coca-Cola agreed to a $21 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit over allegations of inhumane treatment of its cows. The lawsuit claimed consumers were falsely charged a premium because Fairlife promoted well-treated cows. Last year, Fairlife broke ground on a massive production facility in New York state, but Coca-Cola “is going to look for more categories” to expand its offerings, Falorni said. Coca-Cola is “very focused on Fairlife because it’s going very nicely. But I don’t think they’re going to stop there in terms of the portfolio diversification,” he said.\n",

      "Summary: I noticed the compulsive behaviors first. The way, at any pause or break in my day, my finger clicked the Instagram or X app on my phone, seemingly without my consent. Eating a snack? Click. Sitting on the toilet? Click. In bed, in the moments before falling asleep? Click again. Every time the app began to load, I yelped, closed it in a frenzy and switched over to my email or, in one very desperate case, the weather app. Unplugging from social media was proving harder than I expected. Still, any attempts at unplugging for me would be inherently temporary — I use the apps almost daily as part of my job, making fully disconnecting from Big Tech a lost cause. But that’s something a number of social media users have been trying to do, especially after Meta and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have aligned with President Donald Trump — foregoing fact-checkers and incorporating two Trump allies into high positions in the company. Many on the left have called for a boycott of Meta products Instagram and Facebook, while others have taken the opportunity to simply re-evaluate their relationship to social media and, by extension, Big Tech. The movement to boycott Meta is only the latest iteration of an ongoing cultural shift. In November, following Trump’s election, millions of users joined Bluesky, a nearly identical app to pre-Elon Musk X, right down to the shade of blue. Their reasoning was largely due to Musk’s own political alliance with Trump, which had turned the once-innovative social website into a campaign platform for the right. Which brings us to this moment. While attempting to ditch social media isn’t necessarily a new trend — the potential dangers of these websites have long been documented, from mental health woes to privacy concerns — there is now an increasing skepticism around the politics of Big Tech specifically, leading people to find alternatives (i.e. Bluesky) or simply hang it up altogether. But in 2025, social media is so ingrained in our society. These websites have woven themselves not only into the fabric of how we socialize, but of how we communicate as a whole. Is unplugging really possible? I was skeptical. So, at least temporarily, I decided to give it a try. If nothing else, giving up social media — which for me meant X, Facebook and Instagram, the only three sites I regularly use — was an embarrassing window into all the ways I lean on the apps as part of my regular routine. It wasn’t just to fill the empty space in my days; I reached for these apps to browse discounted vintage furniture (Facebook Marketplace), to send cringey jokes to friends (X), or to check the hours of a favorite pop-up restaurant (Instagram). It was confusing. On one hand, I could recognize the dangerous way endlessly scrolling, searching for another hit of dopamine, was damaging my quality of life. (In place of social media, I began to spend an unnatural amount of time checking email, finally reading all those Substacks I’m subscribed to). On the other hand: How else could I get this useful information while also staying in touch with long-distance friends? (Not to mention the ungodly amount of things somehow connected to Facebook/Meta accounts – Spotify?!) I turned to my friend Marissa Butler, an independent bookseller who, like me, is an avid social media user in her late 20s. After Meta announced changes to its fact-checking policy, she posted on Instagram Stories asking her circle how they were thinking about their social media use. Were they deleting Meta apps or social media altogether? Were they re-evaluating their usage? Or were they just continuing as normal? Some people said they were going to give Bluesky a try. Others had already left Instagram, having quit as soon as the news broke. But about 90% of her friends, she said, were just as unsure as she was. “It also made me think, if we could quit social media in general — like we all would honestly probably love to do — what are we losing connection-wise?” she asked. That ability to connect is social media’s great saving grace, the quality that constantly gets named when defending these apps’ existence. For all their faults, how else could we interact with people from around the world? It’s not just discovering that someone you had a single class with in college just had a baby (although it is for that, too). “Buy nothing” groups help locals trade and barter for goods; people fundraise and share mutual aid opportunities; citizen journalists in Palestine even used it to document the war. “Social media platforms, in and of themselves, can be seen as intrinsically neutral,” said Daniel Miller, director of University College London’s Centre for Digital Anthropology. While Musk’s intervention in X is a special case, “by and large, what these sites become is determined by users.” And every user’s relationship with social media can be different. Miller, who has worked with terminally ill patients in hospice, pointed out that having access to social media becomes all the more valuable for patients as they become less mobile. Barred from real-life social interaction because of their health, virtual social interaction becomes a saving grace. “Social media is used for a thousand different things,” Miller said. “You’re going to like some of them, not like some of them. But what it is now is all of those things.” Miller’s words echoed in my mind. At this point, my compulsive reaching for my phone had already begun to decline, but I wondered what long-term unplugging would look like, particularly for my long-distance friendships. Sure, I could always give friends a call, but it’s far easier to comment on an Instagram post once in a while than commit to a 30-minute catch up. My circle would inevitably shrink. Was that a consequence I was ready to accept? Jennifer Oaks, a 48-year-old nurse, was one of the thousands who created a Bluesky account the day after the election. Ideally, she told me, she would go ahead and get off all social media. It’s just not good for her mental health, she said. Every time she opened X, she felt like she was being bombarded with things that made her angry or upset. The constant scrolling, she said, was getting to her. “I just feel like I’m just wasting my life on this social media,” Oaks said. “It’s just brain rot.” Oaks isn’t alone in her feelings. In the 2019 self-help book “Digital Minimalism,” computer scientist Cal Newport wrote about our increasing reliance on these websites and how to curb our usage. “Increasingly, (these technologies) dictate how we behave and how we feel, and somehow coerce us to use them more than we think is healthy, often at the expense of other activities we find more valuable,” Newport wrote. Therein lies the problem, at least as I saw it just 48 hours into my fast. Social media is both brain rot and a source of connection and information. The difference between the two, it seemed, depended on me. I found myself wanting to scroll during lengthy phone calls and television commercial breaks. But I also wished I could see what my favorite journalists were talking about on X, or check what sales my favorite small, independent brands were having (a very niche thing I use Instagram for: the abundant temporary sales on Stories). “It’s like a centralized place to get a lot of things, which is an improvement on having to go around and find all these things individually or call and just check around,” Butler said. “There is no real way to substitute that.” Community bulletin boards have diminished, along with most print neighborhood newsletters. Ironically, we’ve replaced them with Facebook community pages and Nextdoor groups (another form of social media, if we’re being honest). There’s a growing Luddite movement among some teenagers, choosing — out of frustration with the grip social media has on society — to go without those sites and other modern technology. I admire them. But I couldn’t help but feel like that’s an easier choice to make in high school, when your community is largely confined to school. My friends and family live in other states, even other countries. Keeping up takes real work. And how else do people find their favorite small businesses? Artists? Brands? Without social media, this knowledge can become more elusive. I discovered At Heart Panadería, a pop-up bakery in Atlanta that became a mainstay of my diet last year, through Instagram. Chef and owner Teresa Finney, 40, has been on some sort of social media since she was a teen, she said. But today’s social media — with its rapid acceleration of AI and other concerns — bums her out. In recent weeks, she’s grappled with her Instagram usage, but leaving social media doesn’t make sense for her, she said, both personally and professionally. She’d miss seeing the digital lives of her family and friends. And while she does block Instagram for certain hours of the day, she still enjoys posting updates about her life and the bakery (Finney uses the app almost as an extension of a website, posting updates on menu changes, news about pop-ups and pictures of her cakes). “Leaving Instagram, though very tempting at times, would leave a big lack that I’m not at this point ready to live with,” Finney said. As my period of social media abstinence came to an end, I wondered if three days was too short of a time. It certainly isn’t enough time to break a habit, and while my compulsions had plummeted, I still caught myself trying to open the apps. Social media is meant to be addictive — that much is proven. From the constant notifications to the stream of never-ending content, there’s always — for better or worse — something new to see. Did it have to be this way? For years, watchdogs have noted tech companies have the power to control their platforms’ misinformation, hate speech, and other rampant ills that fester on social media. While wellness experts have told us ways to make our specific feeds less toxic (unfollowing people we don’t like; using the mute button), our efforts mean little without systemic changes. And it’s clear that these apps have intentions beyond just being a tool of connection; one scroll through my redownloaded Instagram, and I was reminded of how much the app has become a breeding ground for brands (ones the algorithm thinks I’ll enjoy) hawking their products. I knew going without social media would be a sacrifice; I didn’t realize how much engaging with it was, too. I was always going to be fighting the urge to endlessly immerse myself in the brain rotting scroll, probably at the expense of my data. If these big social media apps were truly just a way to stay in touch with people, why do so many people feel compelled to leave? (Few have complained about needing a BeReal break.) Butler has a healthier approach than I do. She told me she tries to make sure she’s using social media intentionally, like to message someone whose number she doesn’t have or to see what a specific person has been up to, rather than just scrolling out of habit. Instead of sending memes back and forth, wouldn’t it be more fulfilling to get a voice note from a friend, or even just a text? She’s been playing with that, seeing how she can replicate the feelings of being on social media while still regulating her use. “The solution is going to be uncomfortable,” Butler said. “We’re going to be a little less informed than we were before.” Seventy-two hours in, I felt a little uncomfortable. A little freer, too. Unplugging is possible. Here’s the problem: Social media isn’t going away, Miller said. It’s become too much of a part of the way we interact. People (like me) might use social media in detrimental ways, but they also use social media to actually be social. If Miller wanted to announce a conference on X, he has 12,000 followers on the site who might hear about it, he said. How else would he reach those people? “People who have benefitted, in terms of their access to information or the ability to disseminate information, why would they want to leave it?” Miller said. But is that access, that potential benefit, worth all of the downsides? Wouldn’t it be nice for my tastes not to be dictated by an algorithm; to find connection not just within these apps, but beyond them? The answers will be different for everyone. Figuring out how to engage with social media in a healthy way will be a constant balancing act – one that may look different at different stages. (Taking a break from some platforms is a common solution: In 2023, 60% of US adults reported taking a hiatus from X, according to the Pew Research Center, although only a quarter said they were likely to stop using it completely.) As I logged into my various accounts again, I remembered I meant to follow a friend who was moving in a few weeks to another state. I typed her name into the search bar and hit request, settling in with the knowledge that our current jovial relationship would likely diminish to just this: comments and messages through an app. Maybe that’s better than nothing. Or maybe I’ll do the seemingly impossible and give her a call.\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/health/apple-cider-vinegar-netflix-gaps-wellness/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Netflix’s new series “Apple Cider Vinegar” certainly takes aim at wellness influencers, but the Western medical system isn’t safe from criticism either. The show is a dramatization of the story of Belle Gibson, a convicted Australian scammer who claimed she had terminal brain cancer who is played by Kaitlyn Dever, and the impact she had by selling books and an app that claimed clean eating made her well again. Also featured is a fictionalized representation of one of the people Gibson impacted named Lucy. In the show, her character stops her cancer treatments in hopes that Gibson’s method will cure her in a more compassionate way than the hospital system. Show creator Samantha Strauss said the character of Lucy was important to depict what a lot of people feel when fighting a disease: not listened to, not in control and not acknowledged as a full person. “So, it makes sense we want to put our faith in the hands of someone (likely beautiful) on the internet,” Straus said in an email. “We know they’re selling us something, but when you’re terrified that you’re sick and dying, or that someone you love is sick and dying, you can’t put a price on hope.” The problems depicted in the show are not just a work of fiction. There is a real need for more widespread preventative and lifestyle treatment in the US medical system, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Massachusetts. “There are many patients who are suffering from auto immune diseases, chronic pain diseases, other chronic diseases where their regular medical system has failed them,” he said. “It’s basically just doing kind of Band-Aid fixes to get them past their symptoms.” “It’s entirely understandable that people are starving … for information around healthy eating,” Mozaffarian said. Diseases that the scientists know are connected to diet –– including diabetes, heart disease, depression and gut problems –– are rampant, he said. And not enough funding has gone into research about how other health problems are connected to what you eat, Mozaffarian said. That means many times you go to see a doctor they aren’t going to have a lot of current information on how foods or behaviors impact your concerns, he said. “You have this perfect storm of widespread disease, widespread confusion and widespread desperation for information,” Mozaffarian added. “And while that craving for better nutrition information can be a good thing, it also leaves people open to people with half-true or completely false health claims to step in.” In addition, people don’t always feel comfortable bringing their wellness practices to their doctor, said Dr. Summer Allen, a family medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “They don’t feel like they’re going to have someone give them an open mind or try to understand what’s drawn them to a certain behavior or to a certain lifestyle or health,” she said. Traditionally, medicine has worked in a paternalistic way, she said. You explained your symptoms to your doctor, they told you what to do, and you did it. “That’s just not where we’re at from a society standpoint, given just the abundance of knowledge and information we have now, and also because people really are experts about their body and what they’re experiencing,” she said. Ideally, everyone would have a team of health care providers who collaborated with you and could help guide you in the behavioral changes to improve your health, but unfortunately, that isn’t always easy, Allen said. But as some professionals in the field advocate for a more whole-person approach, there are things you can do to connect with resources who can help you integrate prevention, behavior and alternative approaches into your care, she said. The American College of Lifestyle Medicine has a certification for doctors who specialize in behavioral medicine, and you can search for a doctor near you in the database, said Dr. Jonathan Bonnet, a lifestyle medicine-certified physician and clinical associate professor (affiliate) at Stanford University School of Medicine. Not all insurance plans cover it, but nutritionists are also really helpful for wading through what nutrition “hacks” are worthwhile and what you should focus your diet on for better health, Mozaffarian said. The truth is, the things that are shown to be most important to your health aren’t exciting and they aren’t a product you can buy, Bonnet said. “If anyone is telling you, hey, this is going to change our world and cure everything, that would be more suspect,” Bonnet said. “The larger the claim, the more suspicious I would be.” Sleeping well, eating whole foods, getting physical activity, reducing your stress and maintaining close relationships should be your biggest priorities –– whether you are fighting a disease or not, he added. When a new hack or wellness trend pops up, Mozaffarian recommends utilizing a triangle of trust, that is three sources that you trust sharing positive information about it. They could be a government source, a university site, a trusted physician or even studies in a medical journal, he added. But you don’t have to choose between traditional or alternative medicine, Mozaffarian said. They can work together. “There are some really good functional medicine doctors who have spent their careers thinking about these things and trying to go to the root cause of disease,” he said. “But there are also a lot who don’t know really what they’re doing.” And practices that are seen as outside the US medical system, like acupuncture and meditation, actually do show real scientific benefit, he added. “There have been randomized trials showing that they make a difference in people’s lives and sometimes even beat out medicines for certain conditions,” Mozaffarian said. Whatever practices or supplements you try, just be sure to tell your doctor about it, Allen said. Some patients are scared to disclose alternative methods they have tried, but it is important that your doctor know so they do not prescribe anything that is harmful when combined with what you are already doing, she said. At the end of the show (spoiler alert), next to depictions of the downfall of a wellness scammer, the audience sees Lucy going for her chemotherapy treatments while also doing yoga, taking ice baths and meditating. Balance is key, Strauss said.\n",

      "Headline: Democrats confront their powerlessness as they take on Trump\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/politics/democrats-strategy-powerless-trump/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Amid Democrats’ shock and bickering over how much to respond to President Donald Trump is a deeper question rippling through leaders across the Capitol and across the country: How much should they rely on the same institutional and procedural maneuvers they used during the first Trump term, and how much are they willing to wield their own wrecking balls? Democrats remain essentially leaderless, with prospective future presidential candidates largely sitting back and allowing others to be the first ones through the buzzsaw of Trump and his cheerleaders, none eager to be the face of a party just yet. They are disconnected from the Democratic National Committee, where the Obama-era rallying cry of “Yes We Can!” became the watered down facsimile slogan “Yes We Ken!” for Ken Martin, the largely unknown insider who emerged as the winner of the recent chair race that the party’s most prominent figures avoided. Those Democrats left trying to take charge doubt the slower court challenges can keep up with the rapid, precision onslaught mounting each day from presidential appointees and associates of Elon Musk. For whatever judgments do come out in their favor, many believe – though few will yet say so publicly – that Trump may soon just start ignoring what he doesn’t like, and they’ll have no recourse. Trump dismissed this on Tuesday, telling reporters in the Oval Office, “I always abide by the courts,” just days after Vice President JD Vance had tweeted, “Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power” — and days before Trump posted on Saturday, “He who saves his country does not violate any law,” a line nearly matching one that appeared in a 1970 movie about Napoleon. What hopes Democrats have to counter Trump rest for now on the mid-March government budget deadline, the first real inflection point for a party that is not just in the minority in the House and Senate, but facing a Republican majority so in thrall to the president that they cheer him on as he rapidly absorbs powers from Congress, while they’re left holding contrived attempts to visit buildings that Trump and Musk have locked shut while they dismantle operations inside. “I’m not going to stand by and support an effort to dismantle our democracy through the budgeting process,” said Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, as he left a rally outside the offices of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to protest its overnight shuttering by the White House, where he and two dozen colleagues pledged not to vote for any bill until, as the co-founder of the group Indivisible put it, “this Constitutional crisis is over.” Johnson argued that the whole mentality is different from the December shutdown threat, when Democrats also complained but ultimately provided enough votes to make up for Republican defections even though they got limited concessions. “We’ve got to do everything we can, every tool in the toolbox to oppose what is actually happening right before our eyes,” he said. That kind of emergency protocol is crashing into Democrats in the House and Senate who remain confident history will repeat. “I remember eight years ago when skeptical reporters were seeing protests and said, ‘Oh come on, it’s almost two years until the midterms, will people really stay engaged and energized? The answer proved to be yes. And in fact, the numbers even grew,” said Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, as he headed on Thursday to a long hearing over the budget that Democrats hope lets them win back some ground. Others argue they have to be the ones to hold the institutions in place, keeping their resistance within bounds of forcing debates through the night on votes they are going to lose and rallies in front of buildings that Trump has locked them out of, where they say things like “a rally a day keeps the fascists away,” as Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin did at the CFPB rally, and then head home again with their signs. “Clearly this is a man that is driving an agenda that’s breaking the law, violating civil service laws, violating common sense, violating fiscal prudence, benefiting corrupt practices,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, when asked by CNN if he thought Democrats were doing as much as he wants to push back on the president. “You pull every lever that you have on things that you disagree on, but I have to say, this idea that to shut the whole place down…” Booker said, his voice trailing off, and then affirming he does not support any kind of government shutdown. “The levers that we have are limited, but at the same time, all of us share the lever of speaking out, of raising popular sentiment.” For top Democrats in and out of elected office, every day is an existential tug-of-war between worrying about sounding like shrill paranoiacs and worrying that they are not saying or doing nearly enough. They don’t know what the next three-and-a-half years are supposed to be when they already hit “Constitutional crisis” in the first three-and-a-half weeks. “The reason people feel angry about what’s happening is not because we’re not doing everything in our power,” argued Rep. Sean Casten, a Democrat from Illinois. “It’s because they’re wondering, when in God’s name did it become partisan to defend the Constitution? Why is it partisan to say that it’s bad to give Nazi salutes? Why is it partisan to say the Reconstruction amendments that provide equal protection for all are not worth defending anymore?” Casten, like several of his House Democratic colleagues who spoke to CNN, said he has been surprised and heartened by how many constituents have been calling into tele-town halls, and by the responses he has been hearing: “In three weeks, the public mood has gone from apathy to fear to anger. And I think the next thing in that cycle is action.” But Casten said that activist leaders have told him and colleagues that they fear protests against Trump might eventually be used as a predicate for declaring martial law. Other House Democrats echoed this privately, and several left-leaning activist group leaders told CNN directly that their own safety concerns for participants have risen since the president’s blanket pardons for January 6 rioters. “It only took 50 days for Hitler to destroy democracy in Germany,” Casten said, arguing that there are direct parallels to those moves and much of what Trump is doing. “Part of our job right now as Democrats in Washington inside of this is to be Churchillian, very clear-eyed about what the stakes of this moment are, what the parallels in history are, remind people that the majority of Americans are good people, and that the way you shut a bully down is to punch back.” Trump aides regularly dismiss comments like this. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Democrats were projecting, arguing that with judgments that have been stopping the president’s executive orders, “the real Constitutional crisis is taking place within our judicial branch.” In the halls of the Capitol, Democrats’ plaintive hopes a few Republican allies might join them in opposing certain Trump moves is quickly curdling into scorn and disgust. “My impression is that nothing is more miserable right now than being a Republican member of Congress. They’re at Mar-a-Lago over at the White House when he’s signing the executive orders. Are they being brought in at all to his plan? They’re not at all,” said Rep. Haley Stevens, a Michigan congresswoman. “They’re neutering their own leadership.” Casten said as he walks around on the floor and hears Republican colleagues quietly telling him they agree with some of what he’s saying about Trump. He now sees people he suspects are so convinced that they’re in end times to feel they “are never going to have to worry about another democratic election,” or at least wouldn’t object if the situation came to that. “How are you feeling?” he recalled a colleague asked him while they were sitting in the House chamber the other day. “I’m feeling,” Casten said, referring to only his Democratic colleagues, “like there’s only 213 people in this room that I’d trust in a foxhole.” Kicking off a Congressional Progressive Caucus meeting this week, new chair Texas Rep. Greg Casar read from Franklin Roosevelt’s 1936 speech to the Democratic convention, where he spoke about “clouds of suspicion, tides of ill-will and intolerance gather darkly in many places,” and said “privileged princes of these new economic dynasties, thirsting for power, reached out for control over government itself.” “We should be talking about the fact that it is not immigrants that are raising your rent, it is hedge funds that are buying up your neighborhoods and raising your rent. It is not LGBT Americans that are screwing up, you have, your health care, it’s corporate CEOs who are,” Casar said. “If we don’t want to continue in this cycle where we win, then we lose, we win, then we lose, but we keep trending downward, we have to fundamentally transform what the Democratic Party has become in the last 25 years.” Casar argued this will start to catch and become the pushback that still hasn’t come organically, like eight years ago. “Pretty soon everyone’s going to be feeling it, and people are going to look back at stories from this last week or two and they’re like, that was a kind of awkward time, but it’s fine,” he said. In polls and focus groups across an array of internal Democratic groups and allies, described to CNN, centering on talking about prices remains the most prevalent advice — and it’s where House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries has kept returning to, flanked by signs at his two most recent weekly press conferences headlined “HOW IS THIS LOWERING COSTS?” and “REPUBLICANS BETRAY THE MIDDLE CLASS.” Jeffries conceded, when pressed by CNN, that voters hadn’t bought this argument from voters last year, but he insisted the difference now is that Republicans haven’t delivered. Jeffries, who likes baseball as much as he likes historical statistics, sees an example of Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who has one of the highest whiff rates in baseball, but also led the league in both walks and home runs. This is a lesson, he says, in not swinging at everything. Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are wrangling behind the scenes about who can keep their own members in line and for what. But with Schumer 20 years older, further in the minority now and much less likely to have a realistic shot at getting back to the majority in the 2026 midterms, Democrats’ political attention against Trump is zeroing in on the House. Jeffries and his team believe they will have more pressure to exert as the budget talks near, with swing district Republicans in their tiny majority already signaling that they will oppose cuts the leadership is putting forward, in addition to the expected House Freedom Caucus defections. But they are also carefully watching how public mood is shifting on the ground in the most closely divided districts, not yet convinced that voters want the kind of resistance to Trump that they or the loudest activists are demanding Shortly before he left the Capitol to spend a week back in his own district and listening to what his members will be hearing in their own, Jeffries paused for a moment when asked what he would say to Democrats who have given up hope. “Keep hope alive. The Trump administration is losing in court, not winning. Over and over and over again,” he said. “And they have not achieved a single legislative victory. And his approval ratings aren’t going up—they’re going down.” The challenge for Jeffries and his fellow Democrats as they search for a way forward is the new political reality: Trump has already notched one court win on his plans to reduce the federal workforce, he signed into law a GOP-led bill to require the detention of undocumented migrants charged with certain crimes that drew Democratic support and his poll numbers are as high as they have been in his 10 years in politics.\n",

      "Summary: • Trump’s agenda: President Donald Trump is forging ahead with his plans to remake the US government, facing mounting legal challenges as he purges the federal workforce. The new administration’s first Supreme Court appeal will center on Trump’s firing of a government ethics watchdog, which was halted by a lower court. • Wartime diplomacy: Top Trump officials will meet with Russian counterparts for Ukraine peace talks in the coming days, as concern grows in Kyiv and across Europe about the administration’s approach to ending Russia’s war. Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel today, arriving at the same time as new heavy bombs from the US. • Party moves: Democrats are still without an obvious leader and grappling with shock and bickering over how to counter Trump’s presidency, with a mid-March government budget deadline looming as a potential inflection point. Meanwhile, GOP-led states have moved to mirror the president’s agenda. Talks between the US and Russia over the war in Ukraine are set to begin Tuesday, multiple sources told CNN. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and national security adviser Mike Waltz are all traveling to Saudi Arabia for the talks, CNN previously reported. A Saudi official told CNN the Saudi team will be involved in a mediation role. The team will be led by their national security adviser. A Ukrainian official confirmed they will not be present at the talks, though Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s Russia-Ukraine envoy, discussed a “dual track” set of negotiations and will be in Kyiv this week. President Donald Trump also said Sunday that the Ukrainians will be part of the negotiations. Some background: Trump has talked openly about the Saudis playing a key role in the negotiations, and the country has been an important part of US foreign policy under his presidency. It was just a week ago that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman helped facilitate the release of detained American Marc Fogel in Russia. Trump’s first foreign trip of his first term was to Saudi Arabia in 2017. CNN’s Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting to this post. The Department of Education sent a “Dear Colleague” letter Friday threatening the federal funding of any academic institution that considers race in most aspects of student life. The letter, geared toward all preschool, elementary, secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, as well as state educational agencies that receive financial assistance from the federal government, stated a sweeping and controversial interpretation of federal law following the 2023 Supreme Court decision Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which gutted affirmative action. The instructions are almost certain to draw legal challenges. This interpretation could open a wide range of challenges to courses and literature taught in schools, scholarships for non-White students, and various student organizations including Black fraternities and sororities. “And race-based decision-making, no matter the form, remains impermissible. For example, a school may not use students’ personal essays, writing samples, participation in extracurriculars, or other cues as a means of determining or predicting a student’s race and favoring or disfavoring such students,” the letter reads. The letter also criticized diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, known as DEI, claiming, “Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices.” The letter says the department will “take appropriate measures to assess compliance with the applicable statutes and regulations based on the understanding embodied in this letter” no later than February 28, “including antidiscrimination requirements that are a condition of receiving federal funding.” President Donald Trump says Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky will be involved in the peace negotiations on Russia’s war in Ukraine. The US president could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin “very soon,” he added, as he took questions from reporters in West Palm Beach on Sunday. Asked if Zelensky would be involved in the conversations, Trump said, “He will be involved — yes.” Some context: Trump said earlier this week that negotiations to end the nearly three-year Ukraine war will start “immediately” after holding a “lengthy and highly productive” phone call with Putin. His administration has since sent top delegates to Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian counterparts. Trump’s posture toward Putin — and comments from administration officials about concessions Ukraine may need to make to secure peace — has prompted concern in Kyiv and across Europe that Ukrainian and European leaders will be frozen out of the talks. On tariffs: Trump was also asked by reporters about European countries saying they will ban US food imports in response to his tariffs. “I don’t mind. Let them do it. Let them do it,” Trump said. “They’re just hurting themselves if they do that. I can’t imagine it, but doesn’t matter.” President Donald Trump will ask the Supreme Court to allow him to fire the head of a government ethics watchdog agency in the first appeal from his litigious second term to reach the nation’s highest court. At the center of the appeal is Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel and whom Trump fired this month despite protections enacted by Congress, which require an administration to show cause for dismissing someone from the post before their five-year term has ended. A federal district court temporarily blocked Dellinger’s dismissal while it considers his case, and the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit late Saturday declined to overrule that decision. The Justice Department prepared its appeal to the Supreme Court within hours of that decision. The Justice Department described the district court’s ruling as an “unprecedented assault on the separation of powers,” according to a copy of the appeal obtained by CNN. Catch up on the case here. President Donald Trump announced his nominations to head the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the US attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and a new adviser to help run the National Archives in a series of social media posts Sunday. In another post, Trump said he is nominating Judge Jason Reding Quiñones to serve as US attorney for the Southern District of Florida to “restore Law and Order, prosecute violent crimes and, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.” Trump also announced a new senior adviser, Jim Byron, to help run the National Archives and Records Administration, shortly after the administration forced out senior leadership at the institution in a major shakeup last week. Trump has been highly critical of the archives since the agency asked the Department of Justice to investigate Trump’s mishandling of classified documents after he left office. President Donald Trump is attending the Daytona 500, NASCAR’s premiere race in Daytona, Florida, on Sunday. The presidential limousine, known colloquially as “The Beast,” did ceremonial pace laps around the track before the race started shortly after 2 p.m. ET. The president addressed the drivers over the radio during his pace laps, saying he’s a “big fan” and wishing them a good race. He later told the Fox broadcast “there’s spirit again” in the country and around the world. Earlier today, Trump released a statement that said the event “showcases the fastest, most fearless drivers in motorsports, who represent our Nation’s love of tradition, competition, and automotive innovation.” This year’s Daytona 500 features 41 drivers racing for 500 miles to win NASCAR’s largest purse. Trump’s race appearance comes shortly after he made history as the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl. This post has been updated with details about Trump’s appearance at the race. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he knew about US President Donald Trump’s vision for a US takeover of Gaza before it was announced. In a cabinet meeting on Sunday speaking about US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Israel, Netanyahu said, “We have a shared strategy, we are coordinated, and we are working in full cooperation. This has been happening even before President Trump published his vision for Gaza, a revolutionary vision, which holds enormous change for the state of Israel.” Remember: At a joint news conference alongside Netanyahu earlier this month, Trump announced an idea for the US to “take over” Gaza, relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries, and redevelop the war-torn enclave into what he described as the “Riviera of the Middle East.” It was an unprecedented proposal for a sitting US president to float publicly, and prompted swift backlash from the leaders of Arab countries and across the world. The Israeli leader had previously referred to Trump’s idea as a “revolutionary, creative vision.” Multiple top prosecutors appointed by former President Joe Biden to federal districts across the country were left without official means to communicate Friday after their government-issued phones and email accounts were deactivated, two sources familiar with the move tell CNN. The United States attorneys were provided no explanation why their electronic communications suddenly stopped working, sources said, and as of Sunday they still had not received a response from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General seeking details. The disruption in electronic communication experienced by several of the nation’s senior prosecutors was first reported by Bloomberg. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. It is unclear how many prosecutors were specifically impacted, but nearly two dozen US attorneys appointed by Biden are believed to still be on the job. Why this matters: While it is not unusual for an incoming administration to replace chief prosecutors, who serve as Senate-confirmed political appointees, the sudden inability of US attorneys still serving to communicate presents a potential threat to public safety, sources said. In addition to managing the daily functions of their respective offices, US attorneys are key players in the government’s response to urgent national security incidents such as a terrorist attack, where their approval may be needed in order for investigators to seek emergency court authorizations. The disruption in official communication services Friday set off a scramble by those impacted to ensure their staff and law enforcement partner agencies had alternate personal phone and email information in the event of an emergency, sources said. President Donald Trump’s administration is working on a plan to combat avian flu as Americans face sparse supply and high prices for eggs at grocery stores across the country. Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, told CBS on Sunday that he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins will present Trump with a plan next week. Hassett blamed egg supply issues on the Biden administration’s strategy of killing chickens to mitigate the spread of avian flu. Hassett said the goal is a “smarter” method that would avoid killing the chickens by using biosecurity measures and medication to ensure safety. “We’re finalizing the ideas about how to do that with the best scientists in government,” he said on “Face the Nation.” Key context: While agricultural experts say politicians in Washington and around the country can do more to help curtail avian flu, they largely agree the egg shortage is not former President Joe Biden’s fault. It’s not Trump’s, either, but the president has now inherited the issue after campaigning on promises to immediately bring down prices, particularly at the grocery store. The US’ approach to bird flu has long focused on eradication. However, that strategy may be shifting as the virus spreads to other types of animals and becomes harder to contain. Last week, the USDA gave conditional approval to a bird flu vaccine for use in chickens, according to the vaccine’s maker, Zoetis. Several countries already vaccinate chickens against bird flu. Americans can continue to expect high prices for eggs over the course of this year, new estimates show. CNN’s Jamie Gumbrecht and Vanessa Yurkevich contributed to this report. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says there is bipartisan support in Congress for Ukraine, despite what she called a “mixed message” coming from the Trump administration. In an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Shaheen called out seemingly contradictory statements in recent days by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top administration officials regarding whether it’s realistic for Ukraine to join NATO or ever return to its pre-2014 borders. Shaheen praised Senate Armed Services Commitee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, for telling Politico he was “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments making concessions about the future of Ukraine. Shaheen said there is a “great deal of concern” among allies at the conference about the “US position on Ukraine,” and highlighted how lawmakers assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky there is “no daylight between the United States and our NATO allies and our European allies” in holding Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable through sanctions. Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East, is playing a central role in the Trump administration’s approach to securing peace in both Gaza and Ukraine. Here’s what he said today on each front: Gaza ceasefire: Witkoff expressed confidence that phase two of the uneasy ceasefire and hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas would take place. “Phase two is absolutely going to begin,” he said during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” noting that he spoke by phone today with leaders in Israel, Qatar and Egypt. Phase two of the ceasefire would include the return of 19 Israel Defense Forces soldiers, whom the US believes to be alive, as well as others, including American citizen Edan Alexander. In a statement today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio applauded the release of three more hostages by Hamas on Saturday, but warned the group’s leaders that they are “playing with fire” as negotiations continue over the release of their remaining captives. Rubio called on Hamas to release remaining hostages immediately. Ukraine war negotiations: Witkoff told Bartiromo he’s traveling with a US delegation to Saudi Arabia on Sunday to begin talks with senior Moscow officials aimed at ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, as CNN has previously reported. He described the upcoming negotiations as “trust-building” toward the ultimate goal of ending the war. Witkoff disputed criticism that Ukraine isn’t part of the Saudi Arabia talks, pointing to President Donald Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other high-level Trump officials’ engagement with Ukrainian officials. “I don’t think this is about excluding anybody. In fact, it’s about including everybody,” Witkoff said. CNN’s Alison Main contributed reporting to this post. Plans for President Donald Trump’s team to meet with senior Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days mark the first steps in a process to determine whether Russia is serious about ending its war in Ukraine, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday. Pressed on whom he would be meeting, Rubio said, “Nothing’s been finalized yet.” CNN has reported that the Kremlin is assembling a group of top political, economic and intelligence personnel to participate in the talks. Rubio indicated both Ukraine and European leaders would be brought into the negotiations if talks progress in the right direction — comments that come a day after the US special envoy on the conflict, Keith Kellogg, said Europe would not have a seat at the table. That fanned fears in Ukraine and across the continent about the new US approach to peace talks. The secretary of state also provided some details about his call yesterday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, which, Rubio said, was meant to establish an open channel of communication. Rubio said he raised the issue of the “very difficult conditions” diplomats are operating under at the US embassy in Moscow. Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin said Sunday that Ukraine should be at the negotiating table for peace talks along with Russia and the United States. When pressed on the fact that Ukraine is not being included in upcoming talks between the Trump administration and Russia in Saudi Arabia — and was not even informed of the negotiations, according to a Ukrainian source — Mullin praised Trump for having separate discussions with both parties. He said the president’s goal was “getting them in separate rooms, talking about what they will accept, and then finding out a negotiation path forward before you bring them to the table,” because bringing the two sides directly together too fast could lead to significant setbacks. The Oklahoma lawmaker said he has not had conversations with President Donald Trump or Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker about whether the US will continue to supply weapons to Ukraine until there is a ceasefire. Democrats are still at the negotiating table with Republicans as the March 14 deadline to fund the government looms, but the party will make sure the GOP shoulders the blame of a potential shutdown, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Sunday. “Republicans have consistently shut down the government in the past, and it would be no surprise if they do just that,” Jeffries said on ABC’s “This Week.” Jeffries said Democrats are looking for a spending agreement that “meets the needs of the American people in terms of their health, their safety, our national security and certainly the economic well-being of everyday Americans.” He said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top House Democratic appropriator, has been in “off and on conversations” with GOP House colleagues, as well as senators, adding, “We’ll see how that unfolds over the next few weeks.” Jeffries said he has not spoken with anyone in the Trump administration on the issue, but he expects conversations across the aisle to “intensify” as the funding deadline approaches. He also called a GOP-led plan to advance President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda, which passed along party lines in the House Budget Committee on Thursday, “out of control” and a “non-starter.” US national security adviser Mike Waltz previewed the key tenets that he said will drive peace talks in the coming days between top Trump administration figures and senior Russian officials to end the war in Ukraine. Waltz said on “Fox News Sunday” that the “key underpinnings” the US will emphasize include securing a permanent end to the war, which “can’t be ended on the battlefield,” a change in how the US distributes foreign aid, and the integration of Ukraine financially with the US. On the last point, Waltz argued being “coinvested” with the US was the best route to Ukraine’s security, pointing to an investment deal handed to Ukraine by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not sign. “Zelensky would be very wise to enter into this agreement with the United States,” Waltz said. “We’re talking about growing the pie for the Ukrainian economy.” Meanwhile, Waltz said long-term military security guarantees for the country need to be “European-led.” Key context: President Donald Trump and his administration have presented a vision for ending the war that appears to allow for key concessions to Russia, raising fears that Ukraine could be marginalized and Europe left out of peacemaking. Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff are planning to travel to Saudi Arabia for the talks with Russia, two sources familiar with the plans previously told CNN. Ukraine was “not informed” about the delegation’s plans, a Ukrainian official told CNN. Zelensky has previously said the country will not accept a peace deal struck between the US and Russia without Kyiv’s involvement. Europe’s role: Waltz said European allies have been engaged in conversations around the Russia-Ukraine conflict. He said Trump spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron this week, and announced an upcoming meeting between Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Élysée confirmed Trump’s conversation with the French president, but did not provide details. CNN has also reached out to the White House National Security Council. Trump administration border czar Tom Homan called it “ridiculous” to suggest New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ decision to let federal immigration agents into Rikers Island was related to the Department of Justice ordering federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against Adams. The concession came after a second meeting, following the charges being dropped, but Homan said it was just the two men talking “cop to cop.” “That’s why I requested a second meeting, to find out what more we need to do, get some of this stuff in place. So I just think, you know, people making a lot about nothing,” he said. Key context: The DOJ’s dismissal “without prejudice” leaves open the possibility of reinstating the charges against Adams. The lead prosecutor on the case, Hagan Scotten, was among those who resigned over the move. He called the action a “dismissal-with-leverage,” and warned in a resignation letter against using “prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials.” Homan on AOC: Homan also said he wants the DOJ to review the definition of “impeding” law enforcement after Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York held a webinar advising people of their legal rights when interacting with ICE. Advising people of their legal rights is not a crime, nor is exercising those legal rights. It is also not legally considered impeding law enforcement to do either. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Sunday that she doesn’t believe the Trump administration’s defiance of court orders has risen to the level of a constitutional crisis, but warned that officials could face legal consequences if they hold firm in ignoring judges. “We’re not quite there yet,” Klobuchar told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” adding that Trump administration officials, including “lower level people,” will have to decide if they’re prepared to face contempt of court charges. The senator said that, ultimately, Trump’s first administration did follow court orders, and that some of her Republican colleagues, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Sens. Chuck Grassley and Josh Hawley, have been voices saying, “You have to follow the rule of law.” NY corruption case: Responding to the Justice Department’s push for prosecutors to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused the administration of using the mayor as a “political pawn.” Potential government shutdown: Asked by Bash if she thinks Democrats should withhold votes from a bill to fund the government beyond March 14 as leverage, Klobuchar argued her party doesn’t want a shutdown, but it is up to Republicans to prevent that from happening, suggesting Democrats are not eager to come to the table in negotiations. Well, that was another very busy week in US politics. It wasn’t easy to keep track of everything going on both in the US and abroad, so if you’re joining us this Sunday, here are some of the key things you should know from the week that was. In the courts: Judges have issued a cascade of rulings in recent days pausing various actions from President Donald Trump’s effort to vastly shrink and reshape the federal government. The legal battles have centered on issues including the Department of Government Efficiency’s access to sensitive federal data systems, attempts to unilaterally freeze billions of dollars in federal funding, and moves to defund transgender healthcare. Internationally: Perhaps one of the biggest lines this week was Trump revealing his plan to hold peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. The call took Ukraine, and Europe, by surprise and sparked panic across the continent, which played out at this weekend’s Munich Security Conference. Now on the outside looking in, European leaders will hold an emergency summit regarding the war on Monday. Of chief concern: Trump has suggested it would be “unlikely” that Ukraine would get much of its occupied land back as a part of the deal. Separately, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel today to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the country’s multi-front conflicts and resisting Iran. It comes at the same time as newly released heavy bombs arrive in Israel from the US. The Biden administration had previously restricted the heavy munitions out of fear they could be used indiscriminately in Gaza. DOJ resignations over Adams case: From Thursday evening to Saturday morning, seven prosecutors in New York and Washington — including top career prosecutors overseeing public corruption cases — resigned instead of complying with orders from the Trump administration to dismiss a corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Adams is now under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and political opponents, who say the dismissal could make the mayor beholden to the Trump administration. Ukraine was “not informed” about the US delegation due to head to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russia on ending the war, a Ukrainian official told CNN. National security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to travel to Saudi Arabia for the meeting with senior Russian officials, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN. Some context: This week, US President Donald Trump suggested it was “unlikely” Ukraine would get back much of its occupied land in the peace negotiations he intends to hold with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump’s comment came after he held a 90-minute phone call with Putin on Wednesday, and it sparked panic across Europe and Ukraine. Top Trump administration officials are set to meet with senior Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine, a source told CNN on Saturday. National security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to attend, according to two sources familiar with the plans. The sources declined to say which Russian officials would be in attendance, but CNN has previously reported the Kremlin is assembling a high-level negotiating team to engage in direct talks with the US, including top-level political, intelligence and economic figures. How we got here: President Donald Trump said earlier this week that negotiations to end the nearly three-year Ukraine war will start “immediately” after holding a “lengthy and highly productive” phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The call, which was the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end. Zelensky’s concerns: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky warned at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that the days of guaranteed US support for Europe are over. “The old days are over — when America supported Europe just because it always had,” he added. Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on stage at the security conference, Zelensky conceded that he was “not happy” that Trump’s first call was with Putin. The Ukrainian leader warned it would be even “more dangerous” however if Trump meets with the Russian president before him. Ukrainians tell CNN they are fearful any Trump-brokered ceasefire will be full of concessions to Russia and false promises. European leaders on the outside looking in: Zelensky’s warning came just hours before Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration’s Russia-Ukraine envoy, told the same conference that European negotiators would not be at the table for peace talks. The Europeans’ positions would be taken into consideration, Kellogg said, adding that that’s one of the reasons he’s in Munich. But they won’t be participants, the retired US general said. The Trump-Putin phone call has been viewed as a potential turning point in US-European relations. A shipment of heavy bombs from the United States has arrived in Israel, as Marco Rubio visits the country on his first official trip to the region since becoming US secretary of state. The munitions were sent after President Donald Trump’s administration last month lifted a hold on the deliveries, Israel’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday. The release of the heavy bomb shipments rolled back one of the few Biden-era policies meant to exert leverage on Israel during its war in Gaza. Former President Joe Biden had restricted the delivery of the 2,000-pound bombs out of concern they could be used indiscriminately by Israel’s military in densely populated areas of Gaza. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the shipment of MK-84 munitions “represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States,” in a statement from his ministry. The head of Gaza’s Government Media Office Salama Maroof criticized the US decision. Rubio landed in Tel Aviv on Saturday night, where he was greeted by Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. He is meeting with Netanyahu at his office in Jerusalem Sunday morning, where Trump’s controversial proposal to “take over” the Gaza Strip is likely to come under discussion. Read more about Rubio’s visit here. In less than a month in office, the Trump administration has simultaneously dismantled foreign aid programs that support fragile democracies abroad and put on leave federal workers who protect US elections at home in a move that current and former officials say abandons decades of American commitments to democracy. USAID, the main foreign aid agency, and the State Department have halted funding for democracy and human rights-focused programs. The State Department has also laid off about five-dozen contractors focused on those issues, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The Department of Homeland Security this month put on leave several employees who have worked to protect election systems from security threats at home, including advisers who work in red states on basic, nonpartisan cybersecurity measures. On Friday night, the department told employees it was pausing all of its election security work, pending a review. (Wired first reported on that move.) The damage to democracies around the world from the foreign aid cuts will be felt for years, current and former US officials told CNN. Read more about the fallout from the moves here.\n",

      "Headline: Education Department letter threatens federal funding of any school that considers race in most aspects of student life\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/politics/education-department-race-federal-funding/index.html\n",
      "Summary: The Department of Education sent a “Dear Colleague” letter Friday threatening the federal funding of any academic institution that considers race in most aspects of student life. The letter — geared toward all preschool, elementary, secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, as well as state educational agencies that receive financial assistance from the federal government — laid out a sweeping and controversial interpretation of federal law following the 2023 Supreme Court decision that gutted affirmative action. It’s almost certain to draw legal challenges. “Federal law thus prohibits covered entities from using race in decisions pertaining to admissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, financial aid, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, discipline, housing, graduation ceremonies, and all other aspects of student, academic, and campus life,” wrote Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights for the Education Department. The Supreme Court’s landmark 6-3 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard overturned long-standing precedent that has benefited Black and Latino students in higher education. Donald Trump, at that time the former president, called it a “great day for America.” Trainor said that although the 2023 decision “addressed admissions decisions, the Supreme Court’s holding applies more broadly. At its core, the test is simple: If an educational institution treats a person of one race differently than it treats another person because of that person’s race, the educational institution violates the law.” This interpretation could open a wide range of challenges to courses and literature taught in schools, scholarships for non-White students, and various student organizations, including Black fraternities and sororities. “Race-based decision-making, no matter the form, remains impermissible. For example, a school may not use students’ personal essays, writing samples, participation in extracurriculars, or other cues as a means of determining or predicting a student’s race and favoring or disfavoring such students,” the letter read. The letter says the department will “take appropriate measures to assess compliance with the applicable statutes and regulations based on the understanding embodied in this letter” no later than February 28. It also criticized diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, known as DEI, saying that such programs “frequently preference certain racial groups and teach students that certain racial groups bear unique moral burdens that others do not.” The letter comes as Trump has waged war on DEI efforts, signing an executive order hours after his swearing-in that bans DEI considerations in federal hiring. Dozens of employees at the Education Department were placed on paid administrative leave last month as part of the Trump administration’s larger effort to rid the federal workforce of employees associated with DEI efforts, two sources familiar with the move told CNN. It also comes as the Trump administration has begun drafting an executive order that would kick off the process of eliminating the Department of Education, one of his campaign promises. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly pointed to the department as a sign of federal overreach and tied it to culture war issues. “We will drain the government education swamp and stop the abuse of your taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America’s youth with all sorts of things that you don’t want to have our youth hearing,” he said.\n",

      "Headline: Pro-Palestinian NGO seeks ICC arrest warrant for Israel’s foreign minister\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/middleeast/ngo-seeks-icc-arrest-warrant-israel-saar-intl-latam/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Pro-Palestinian NGO the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF) has filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, seeking a warrant for his arrest, the group said on Sunday. In a statement, HRF called for an arrest warrant for Sa’ar for “war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during Israel’s ongoing military assault on Gaza since October 7, 2023.” The complaint comes ahead of the foreign minister’s expected trip to Brussels next week. CNN has reached out to Sa’ar’s office for comment on the complaint. His spokesperson told CNN that Sa’ar will “carry out his planned visit to Brussels as scheduled.” While neither Israel nor the United States is party to the ICC, Belgium is. “As Belgium is a signatory to the Rome Statute, it has a legal obligation to cooperate with the ICC and take action against individuals accused of serious international crimes,” HRF said. “The Hind Rajab Foundation calls on Belgian authorities to ensure that Sa’ar does not evade justice while on European soil.” “Allowing a suspected war criminal to visit Brussels unchallenged would be a betrayal of international legal commitments and the fundamental principles of justice,” the group added. The HRF is a pro-Palestinian NGO that says it is dedicated “to breaking the cycle of Israeli impunity and honoring the memory of Hind Rajab and all those who have perished in the Gaza genocide.” Rajab was a 5-year-old girl who was killed by Israeli tank fire while in her family’s car in Gaza. The group said Sa’ar played a “central role” in making and implementing policies that have led to “mass displacement, collective punishment, and systematic attacks on Palestinian civilians.” “His public statements and policy endorsements indicate direct and indirect participation in these crimes, as well as incitement to violence and obstruction of international justice mechanisms,” the group said. HRF said Sa’ar publicly advocated for “reducing Gaza’s territory” and endorsed Israel’s “total blockade on Gaza, which has restricted food, water, and medical supplies.” HRF’s complaint also pointed toward “co-perpetration” with the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for whom the ICC issued an arrest warrant, alongside former defense minister Yoav Gallant, in November last year. The group has previously brought a lawsuit against a former Israeli soldier who was on vacation in Brazil, alleging he was responsible for war crimes while serving in Gaza. A Brazilian judge ordered police to investigate the soldier based on HRF’s complaint but he left the country. That lawsuit was one of a series by the group, which has tracked the activities of hundreds of Israeli soldiers serving in Gaza. The Israeli foreign ministry has since cautioned Israelis about social media posts related to their military service, saying “anti-Israeli elements may exploit these posts to initiate baseless legal proceedings against them.”\n",

      "Headline: Trump and Iran may have offer of mediation from Saudi Arabia on new nuclear deal\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/middleeast/saudi-arabia-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Saudi Arabia is open to mediating between the Trump administration and Iran in pursuit of a new deal to limit Tehran’s nuclear program, CNN has learned. The kingdom is concerned that Iran may be more inclined to pursue a nuclear weapon now that its regional proxies – long viewed as a deterrent against Israeli attacks – have been significantly weakened. Saudi Arabia hopes to leverage its close ties with President Donald Trump to provide Iran with a diplomatic bridge to the White House. It is unclear whether Saudi Arabia has made a formal offer, but the move underscores Riyadh’s desire to build on its improved relations with its former foe and secure a seat at the negotiating table for a potential new deal. While Trump has said he wants to enter talks for a new deal, the message from Iran has been mixed, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying last week that talks with the United States were “not smart.” The US State Department and the Saudi foreign ministry didn’t respond to CNN’s requests for comment. Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York said it had no comment. Saudi Arabia publicly welcomed the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers but privately seethed over the Obama administration’s failure to address its concerns about Tehran’s regional activities – particularly its missile program and proxy groups from Yemen to Iraq and Lebanon, which Riyadh viewed as a threat to regional stability. It later welcomed Trump’s 2018 withdrawal from the deal. A year after Trump’s withdrawal, Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities suffered a major drone and missile attack that temporarily cut the crude production of the world’s largest oil exporter in half. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi group claimed responsibility, but the US blamed it on Iran – ultimately stopping short of military action in defense of its Saudi ally. But tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran have eased significantly since then. In March 2023, the two countries made a surprise announcement to normalize relations in a China-brokered agreement. Saudi officials view the deal as a major success, believing Riyadh has reaped its benefits – Houthi attacks on Saudi territory have ceased, and the kingdom was spared in last year’s tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and Iran, despite fears that Tehran might hit Gulf Arab oil installations if its own facilities were hit by Israel. Over the past 15 months, Israel has significantly weakened Iran-allied groups in Lebanon and Gaza and has struck targets in Syria, Iraq and as far as Yemen. Combined with the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, these developments have dealt a serious blow to Iran’s ability to project power beyond its borders. Saudi officials see the current regional landscape as a historic opportunity to de-escalate tensions with Iran and improve ties, insisting that they want no part in any American or Israeli confrontation with the country. They are also concerned that a cornered Tehran may be more willing to develop a nuclear bomb and they view a new nuclear agreement as a way to prevent that. They do not believe a severely weakened Iran serves Saudi Arabia’s interests, as Riyadh has recalibrated its foreign policy to prioritize its economic interests and views further regional instability as an obstacle to progress. Since taking office for the second time, Trump has said that he wants a new deal with Iran. He has reluctantly doubled down on sanctions on the country over its nuclear program and has said that he would “love to” reach a deal and improve relations. “I want Iran to be a great and successful Country, but one that cannot have a Nuclear Weapon. Reports that the United States, working in conjunction with Israel, is going to blow Iran into smithereens,’ ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED,” Trump posted on Truth Social last week. He continued, “I would much prefer a Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper. We should start working on it immediately, and have a big Middle East Celebration when it is signed and completed. God Bless the Middle East!” With Iran’s economy crippled by US sanctions, President Masoud Pezeshkian – who ran for office last year on a platform of global reconciliation – is under intense pressure from his reformist base and regular Iranians to tackle a plummeting currency, massive youth unemployment and chronic power cuts. Signals from Tehran, however, have been mixed. Pezeshkian and other Iranian officials have repeatedly stated their willingness to engage with the Trump administration on a new deal and have said that dialog could follow on “other issues.” But on Monday, Pezeshkian questioned Trump’s sincerity in seeking a new nuclear deal. And last week, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority over state affairs, declared that talks with the US were “not smart, wise, or honorable,” citing the US’ withdrawal from the 2015 deal. He didn’t however outright ban communication with Washington. Firas Maksad, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said that while Saudi foreign policy is anchored in a strategic partnership with the US, Riyadh’s foreign policy “has sought to diversify its options, both regionally and internationally, allowing for flexibility and pragmatism when circumstances dictate.” “Signaling willingness to mediate between President Trump and Iran allows the kingdom to tacitly distance itself from Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Tehran,” he told CNN. He said, however, that given the lingering lack of trust between Saudi Arabia and Iran, “this is unlikely to develop beyond diplomatic signaling.” Riyadh’s ties with Trump – and the extent of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman’s (MBS) influence on him – are likely to be tested by the president’s controversial plan for the US to “take over” Gaza and expel its Palestinian population. The proposal could derail Saudi-Israeli normalization, which both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have aggressively pursued. Last week, Trump struck an optimistic note about Saudi-Israel normalization, claiming Riyadh wasn’t demanding an independent Palestinian state in return. Saudi Arabia swiftly responded, firmly rejecting any plan involving Palestinian displacement and reaffirming that no normalization will take place without Palestinian statehood. Still, Saudi Arabia’s relationship with Trump remains strong. While other US allies tread carefully to avoid provoking him, the kingdom’s international profile and influence is likely to continue growing under Trump. Trump has even suggested Saudi Arabia could be the destination for his first foreign trip as president – again – where MBS may find himself in the unlikely role of mediator between the US and Russia in efforts to end the largest European war since World War II.\n",

      "Headline: How Trump’s policies could reverse decades of progress in Latin America’s HIV response\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/americas/trump-hiv-latin-america-intl-latam/index.html\n",
      "Summary: It was nearly 30 years ago when Rosember Lopez received a life-altering diagnosis: He was HIV positive. With scant government resources for HIV support at the time in Mexico, Lopez joined advocacy groups to secure the funding he needed for medication to help him survive. “In the first years after my diagnosis, it was very difficult for me,” he told CNN. “We had to fight for access to medications,” he added of himself and others with the disease. The experience inspired him to start his own organization in Tapachula, in southern Mexico, to help destigmatize HIV with the help of funding from the United States. Today, his is one of dozens of aid groups across Latin America in jeopardy due to the Trump administration’s freeze on almost all international aid and the gutting of the US’ global development network. The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a George W. Bush-era program that has enjoyed bipartisan support, was among those hit by US President Donald Trump’s actions. Relief groups have warned that halting programs such as PEPFAR could pose a risk to the lives of millions of people who will have to stop their HIV treatment, potentially opening the door to a HIV resurgence. Organizations like Lopez’s help those with the disease access antiretroviral medications needed to reduce the risk of transmission, and give them a chance at a long, healthy life. After hearing about the aid freeze in late January, Lopez began to worry not only about the future of his organization, A Helping Hand in the Fight Against AIDS (UMALCS), but also the deaths that could result from the lack of HIV care. “It took me back to the times when there was no support and I said, ‘Well, now what is going to happen if we are no longer going to have the support of antiretroviral treatments?’” he said. PEPFAR has been a lifeline for those living with HIV and AIDS, saving tens of millions of people across the world since its inception, say advocates. But Trump’s freeze on foreign aid included a stop work order for all aid groups to immediately halt US-funded programs. Despite the State Department later issuing a waiver for “life-saving” assistance, some aid groups say funding is still halted. Contacting USAID officers who grant approval for work to continue has also been increasingly difficult as changes stifle the agency, a source from one US contractor told CNN. CNN spoke to aid organizations and healthcare workers across Latin America who say that following the stop work order, they were unable to distribute vital medicine already on the shelves in pharmacies, including the HIV prevention medication PrEP. An interruption in treatments could allow HIV to rebound in less than a month, in some cases, and could lead to more resistant strains arising, Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency medicine physician and professor at Brown University School of Public Health, told CNN. “We’re shooting ourselves in the face,” he said. Without consistent treatment, Spencer warned that in a span of weeks or months, “We’re going to have people who had their HIV well controlled, who will be uncontrolled. You will have people that could not have transmitted who will be able to transmit now.” If PEPFAR is not reauthorized for the next four years, and without other resources for the HIV response, there would be 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths in the near future, a 400% increase, Christine Stegling, the deputy executive director of the United Nations agency tasked with tackling HIV and AIDS, UNAIDS. “It’s like crash landing an airplane,” Asia Russell, Executive Director of Health GAP, a global HIV treatment advocacy organization, told CNN of the stop work order. “Chaos has already been extreme in the field and recovery from that disruption is not easy.” The lack of US funding is already impacting organizations in Colombia. Some organizations, like Red Somos, which provides HIV care to Venezuelan migrants, have been forced to drastically scale back their operations. David Marquez, the group’s social protection coordinator, told CNN that around 300 Venezuelan migrants with HIV cannot continue their treatment as it was run with PEPFAR support. “This could be dangerous for their life,” Marquez said, adding that the organization is looking to other sources of funding. Without explicit permission from the US to resume work, Red Somos has more than 170 antiretroviral drugs that are nearing their expiration date. The group also had to suspend its educational, social protection and mental health services since January. Miguel Lopez, who was diagnosed with HIV 10 years ago, founded Más Que Tres Letras — which translates to “More Than Three Letters” — to normalize public discourse in Colombia about HIV and where to seek help. While Lopez’s group relies on other donors, he still anticipates fallout from the latest US policy. Lopez and his team worry there might not be enough money to go around as organizations that once relied on US funding are now scrambling to find other donors. “There is not going to be enough money for everyone,” Lopez said. In Haiti, Dr. Alain Casseus and his colleagues at healthcare organization Zanmi Lasante have been severely impacted by the aid freeze. Thousands of Haitians rely on them for HIV care, but “we basically have to reduce our activities,” he told CNN. A USAID worker in Haiti — who was not put on leave — told CNN the State Department’s waiver does not cover some important aspects of HIV care, like psychological and economic support for impacted families. Some approved services can’t immediately resume for aid groups that have already cut down on staff and are operating at reduced capacity. There are parts of Haiti that rely almost solely on American funding for their healthcare needs, the USAID employee said. “If these health facilities were not there, people would receive no medications, no healthcare, nothing.” Without funding, aid groups in Latin America are calling on the international community for help. “We are already feeling the impact, as some US organizations that funded our work in Mexico are now shutting down,” Lopez from Mexico told CNN. “We urgently need international support to sustain our work.”\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/europe/europe-us-ukraine-peace-negotiation-intl-latam/index.html\n",
      "Summary: The future of Ukraine will be discussed this week in Riyadh between Americans and Russians, with neither Europeans, nor, at the time of writing, Ukrainians themselves at the table. The question for European leaders now is: what can any of them do about it? A hastily organized meeting in Paris, for now short on details in terms of attendance, is a measure of their concern as they wake up to the reality of Trump 2.0: that their long-standing American ally is no longer much of an ally and may in fact be far more dangerous to them existentially than they had imagined possible only a week ago. There was, of course, US Vice President JD Vance’s startling speech in Munich on Friday, a rallying cry to the European far right that was quickly seized upon by their news outlets, in which he accused a stone-faced crowd of democratically elected European leaders on their own continent of selling out. In a remarkable and disingenuous twisting of recent European history, Vance accused his audience of having betrayed the very ideals that allies had fought for during World War II. The danger, he said, warming to a theme he had touched upon in Paris just a few days before at French President Emmanuel Macron’s AI summit, was in Europe’s stifling of free speech, warning his audience that they should fear neither Moscow nor Beijing but European leadership itself. It was a speech that went so much further than anyone had anticipated by questioning the moral underpinnings of the NATO alliance itself, rather than simply the operational question of budgetary contributions that had so far been President Donald Trump’s principal gripe. Yet the vice president’s words, as surprising as they were, were not the only ones to set European alarm bells ringing. Another senior American official to speak in Munich was the special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, who sought to reassure the conference with tough words about his plan for extracting concessions from Russian President Vladimir Putin. The American position, he said, was to be tough on Moscow, to demand territory from Russia and security guarantees for Europe. Yet his comments came only days after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told his NATO counterparts in Brussels that he couldn’t see Ukraine joining the alliance at all, sweeping aside in one fell swoop not just the American position thus far but also what many had considered a key piece of leverage as negotiations with Moscow began. The fear for Europeans is not now simply that Americans are preparing to negotiate without them but that they are preparing to negotiate badly without them. And while an invitation to Ukrainian leaders to join the discussions in Saudi Arabia may be in the post, for now the prospect is of American and Russian negotiators gathering around a table to discuss not just the future of the 6 million Ukrainians currently living under Russian occupation but also that of a European security architecture that impacts most closely the people living in Kyiv and Paris and every city in between. The fact is that European countries, like their American ally thus far, spent nearly three years depleting their own arsenals and treasuries in the name of a fight for freedom and democracy that had felt to them existential as the Russian invasion began. That now appears to have been entirely brushed aside in the name of political expediency and the search for peace. And, while peace is also what Europeans aspire to, their worry is now how costly it may be, given the price Washington seems prepared to pay, and how short lived, given Putin’s record. Hence the meeting in Paris. European leaders may not be able to weigh in on the terms of a future peace deal but they do hope to find ways of giving security guarantees to Kyiv. Yet the danger facing them as they head to the French capital is that that just as the fight for Ukraine united them three years ago, so too might the specter of peace on their Eastern flank divide them once more. Particularly at a time when several of them are facing an increasingly emboldened and electorally successful European far right that is far more closely aligned with Washington’s new leaders than they are. But European leaders are also keen not to appear rattled. The French foreign minister explained on French radio on Sunday that these sorts of meetings happened all the time. And Macron himself billed Monday’s talks as “an informal meeting” for those interested “in peace and security in Europe.” For now, we expect not only the presidents of the EU council and Commission to attend, but also the NATO secretary general and the leaders of Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland and Denmark. The British prime minister has also confirmed his presence, with Downing Street calling it a “once in a generation moment” for national security. Few of those heading to Paris had doubted that Trump meant what he said the first time round, it’s more that now he appears to have surrounded himself with people who know exactly what they’re doing when it comes to undermining Europe and dismantling NATO. And they are, it seems, done with doing Europe’s bidding. This will make Monday’s meeting not just about how to help Ukraine, but, at its heart, about how to save Europe itself.\n",

      "Headline: Parents jailed for neglecting daughter they bathed in attention but starved of food\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/australia/australia-malnourished-girl-neglect-hnk-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: By the time the girl was admitted to hospital, her hair was brittle, her skin was flaking, and she was so malnourished that doctors said she was at risk of cardiac arrest and death. She was 17 but looked much younger. Witnesses at the hospital said her parents treated her as if she were a small child.  They took her to the bathroom, wiped her bottom, blew her nose and brushed her hair as she watched cartoons more suitable for toddlers. She weighed just 60 pounds (27.3 kilograms) – about the same size as a 9-year-old. Last month her parents, an Australian couple in their mid-40s, were sentenced to prison in Perth’s District Court of Western Australia for neglecting their only child, even as they ferried her to and from piano and ballet lessons. Neither the parents nor their daughter can be identified, according to an Australian law that seeks to protect child victims. The girl, now 20, declined CNN’s request for an interview. Her father’s lawyer, Oliver Paxman, told CNN his client was “very disappointed” by the outcome and was considering his legal options. Her mother’s lawyer did not respond. In her ruling, Judge Linda Black said it was clear the girl’s parents loved her, but failed in their parental duties to help her develop, physically and emotionally. “This is not a case about a malnourished ballerina,” Judge Linda Black said as she sentenced the father to six and a half years in prison, and the mother to five years –  a reduced sentence to take into account her “personal circumstances.” “You isolated your daughter, you prevented her from growing up, you prevented her from developing in the way she was entitled to. You did keep her as a little girl long beyond the age where she should have been,” Black said. For the purposes of this story, we’ll call the girl Kate. The following details have been sourced from court documents. Kate loved to dance. She was homeschooled by her mother, who quit work when she was born, to take care of her. Most of their time was spent at home, but ballet lessons offered Kate a chance to mix with other children. Photos released by the court show Kate smiling in brightly colored costumes, her hair slicked back, and her feet and arms in the studied pose of a graceful ballerina. “What a beautiful photo of my ballerina princess!” her father commented on one photo posted to Facebook, of his daughter who looked far younger than her 14 years. Kate’s father worked full time to provide for the family, who lived in one of the wealthiest suburbs of Perth, the capital of Western Australia. They were intelligent people, who obviously knew how to feed themselves, the judge said. Yet, they failed to ensure their daughter ate enough food. The couple also failed to let Kate grow up as a normal teenager. Nothing “even remotely age-appropriate” was present in the family’s home, the judge said, pointing to the films and TV shows she watched: Teletubbies, Frozen, and Thomas the Tank Engine. Unlike most teenagers, who were getting their first jobs and scrolling on social media, Kate was having princess birthday parties and receiving Barbie dolls as gifts. And when other girls were going through puberty, Kate ceased to grow or develop. During the trial, her father told the court she was a “fussy eater” who had become a vegetarian at age 8 and turned vegan in her early teens. She ate three meals a day and had access to snacks, he said. He didn’t believe she was malnourished. Vegans avoid eating food that comes from animals, including dairy products and eggs. Their diet is largely made up of fruit, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds. Paxman, the father’s lawyer, told CNN: “This was never a case about withholding food from a child.” “My client didn’t starve his kid … He never withheld food from her. He loved and spoiled his daughter. She was free to eat as much as she wanted. This case was about inadequate nutrition from a vegan diet,” Paxman said. “Every parent on this planet knows that if you don’t give a child enough food they will starve. But what if your kid chooses to be vegan?” Judge Black refused to believe the couple didn’t realize their daughter was seriously unwell. “It seems that everyone in the world who had the opportunity to interact with (Kate) understood she was severely malnourished, except the two people who professed to love her. I simply cannot accept that you didn’t see it. I simply cannot accept that you didn’t notice,” Judge Black said. In fact, Black found they did notice – so much so that Kate’s father forged her birth certificate to make her seem two years younger, partly to hide what was becoming increasingly apparent to other people – their daughter was chronically malnourished. Parents at the ballet school were starting to whisper, and her dance teachers implored her parents to see a nutritionist. They refused, and eventually the teachers notified authorities. By the time Kate was hospitalized at 17, she was 147.5 centimeters (4 feet 10 inches) tall with a body mass index of 12.5 – significantly below the healthy range of 18 to 25. “She was wasted, according to the doctor, with limited body fat. She was pale. She was exhibiting no signs of puberty. Her hair was brittle and thin. Her skin was dry and flaking. Her heart rate was elevated. The doctor said they needed to do an ECG. And the two of you said no,” Judge Black wrote in her ruling. As doctors tried to treat her, Kate’s parents openly discussed their suspicions that a conspiracy was forming around them – and that medical staff couldn’t be trusted. Their daughter was in the Eating Disorder Ward, yet they praised the figure of another patient who was dangerously thin. They told their daughter her stomach was looking full, and made comments that suggested she might get fat if she followed her doctors’ advice. “This, in a context of the dire condition your daughter was in, was … outrageous,” Black wrote. When the couple refused to allow doctors to insert a nasal tube to allow Kate to be fed, and frustrated other attempts to treat her, authorities stepped in and put her into state custody. Without her parents’ intervention, Kate gained weight, and they were arrested and charged. Dr Danielle Einstein, a clinical psychologist and author, said cases like Kate’s are “extremely rare.” She said it’s very common for parents to struggle with the idea that their children will one day leave, but ultimately most want them to grow into responsible adults. Einstein said one of the problems she has encountered through her work is when parents try to shield their children from problems, or do too much for them. “Sheltering is a problem; we don’t want to shelter our children. We want them to continue to grow and develop and be capable without us,” she said. “We’re seeing more anxiety in young adults and in teens because they’re not prepared to face the challenges and overcome the challenges without help.” Kate’s parents didn’t just prevent her from growing up, the court found – they told “a cascading series of lies” from 2016 about their daughter’s age, to cover up their neglect. The first came as her mother signed Kate up for a dance class, giving a date of birth that made her daughter seem six months younger than she really was. Months later, she gave a different birthdate again, to the same dance school, taking off another year, so she appeared 18 months younger. Then in another application, she knocked a full two years off her age. “You deliberately lied because you knew that your daughter did not look or behave like a child of her true age,” Black said. In her sentencing remarks, Black said it was clear that Kate’s parents loved her, but didn’t show it in their actions. “There is nothing unusual in a parent wanting to cling onto their child and be reluctant to let them go and mature and become an adult. Nothing unusual at all,” she said. “But what is wrong is when a parent, in fact, prevents the child from embarking upon and completing that natural process.” “One of your greatest failures was a belief that you could give her what she wanted and failing to give her what she needed,” she continued. “Every parent knows it’s harder to say no to your child than to say yes. You chose to make the easy decisions rather than the hard ones.” Kate’s own words provided more evidence to Judge Black that her parents had failed to give her the skills to function without them. In a letter sent to the judge, appealing to her to drop the prosecution, Kate blamed herself for her parents’ predicament – saying they made her breakfast, lunch and dinner, but she chose how much she ate. “I’m fully dependent on my parents,” she wrote. “All my living expenses are paid by my parents, including clothes, food, money as I need it. My university fees are being paid by my parents.” “I love my parents very much. They are the most important people in my life. If my parents go to prison, I don’t think I’ll be able to cope.” Kate’s father admitted forging her birth certificate, but both parents denied all other charges, while their lawyers pointed to an anxiety disorder to partly explain their behavior. Judge Black said the couple had taken no responsibility for their actions, and she saw no reason not to jail them. “You have shown no remorse. You have shown no acceptance of responsibility. You have shown no insight,” she said. Both will be eligible for parole.\n",

      "Headline: At least 9 dead after powerful storm topples trees and floods roads in eastern US\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/weather/storm-east-us-peak-tornadoes-sunday/index.html\n",
      "Summary: At least eight people died as a powerful storm swept through Kentucky, causing flooding that inundated roads and homes, Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday. Another person died in Georgia, an official there said. Emergency responders are now in a search and rescue phase and have performed over 1,000 rescues in under 24 hours, Beshear said. The governor described the storm as “one of the most serious weather events we’ve dealt with in at least a decade.” Video footage captured in multiple states shows toppled trees, vehicles submerged in floodwaters and inundated houses with widespread reports of flooded roads, businesses and homes in Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia. Water levels reached historic highs in Kentucky as the storm gained momentum Saturday, officials said, two years after catastrophic flooding left 43 people dead and devastated parts of the state. Beshear on Sunday called the impact to the state “massive” and cited “hundreds of water rescues” and “multiple fatalities.” “We need Kentuckians to remain alert. There are more than 300 road closures, with (state transportation) leaders saying the statewide impact is historic,” Beshear posted on social media. “From mudslides in the east to snow in the west, the situation is dangerous. Please plan ahead, avoid travel and stay safe, Kentucky,” the governor said. The deaths include at least one child, Beshear said. “We believe this number is going to grow,” he said, later adding in an interview with CNN Sunday he believed the death toll would “at least” rise to nine. He urged Kentuckians to stay off the roads, adding several of the deaths have been attributed to motor vehicle accidents. Beshear declared a state of emergency for Kentucky ahead of the storm Friday and Sunday thanked President Donald Trump for approving a federal disaster declaration, making federal aid funding available to impacted areas. The severe weather event will “continue for several more days,” Kentucky Emergency Management Director Eric Gibson said Sunday. Beshear warned of continued flooding, including riverbank flooding, in coming days. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is on site in Kentucky, according to Beshear, along with 146 soldiers and airmen from the Kentucky National Guard. The intense rain and flash flooding have prompted evacuations and caused power outages for hundreds of thousands of customers across several states. Parts of West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas and Tennessee were under flash flood emergencies and warnings through Sunday morning. Flood watches in some areas will continue into Monday. Several tornado warnings were issued across Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee late Saturday, before the storm pushed into Georgia on Sunday morning. At least 108,028 customers in Georgia, 75,724 in Alabama, 61,637 in West Virginia and 61,520 in Virginia were without power as of 2:20 p.m. ET, according to PowerOutage.us. In Kentucky, 29,628 were without power. The extreme flooding has also affected Kentucky’s water systems. A total of 9,800 service connections were without water and 21,000 were under boil water advisories Sunday, according to a news release from the governor’s office. At a Kentucky nursing home, 100 residents were evacuated to a local church, the news release stated. Emergency shelters are operating in nine counties across the state. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced Sunday he submitted an Expedited Major Disaster Declaration to President Trump, citing “significant damage that is affecting community lifelines.” This is the fifth major flood to hit the area in the past five years, the governor said in a news release. A flash flood emergency was issued for Tazewell, Mercer and Summers counties in Virginia, where swift water rescues have been underway since Saturday. “The frigid water temperatures that can result in rapid hypothermia for anyone caught in the flooding,” the National Weather Service office in Blacksburg, Virginia, warned. A nursing home in Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee, about 10 miles from the Kentucky border, was forced to evacuate residents Saturday due to rising waters, according to Macon County Emergency Medical Services. Multiple agencies helped in the effort to safely take 52 residents to another facility, where they will remain until water levels recede, county EMS said. In the Richlands, Virginia area, at least 51 people, 17 dogs and eight cats were rescued overnight, according to Virginia Task Force 4. Between 3 and 5 inches of rain have fallen across swaths of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, with isolated instances of more than 6 inches. A 73-year-old resident of Manchester, Kentucky, died in the Horse Creek area after being swept away by floodwaters Saturday night, officials said. The man was driving on Kentucky Highway 8, according to the Clay County Coroner’s Office. He was carried away by the heavy currents after leaving the vehicle, the coroner’s office told CNN. Two more people were confirmed dead in Kentucky after a vehicle was swept away amid flash flooding around 10:30 p.m. Saturday in Hart County, according to a National Weather Service report. And in Georgia, one person died in the Grove Park area of Atlanta overnight when a large tree fell on a home amid “tremendous thunderstorm activity” in the area, Atlanta Fire Capt. Scott Powell said Sunday. Fire units responded to a 911 call made just before 5 a.m. and found one person trapped inside the house, he said. “There was an extended operation to remove that person. Unfortunately, it did result in a fatality,” said Powell. The storm looks set to wane by Monday, but parts of the Great Lakes could be buried by lake-effect snow in its wake. Across the country, over 10 million people remain under a winter storm warning that will last through Monday morning from upstate New York to New England. Snowfall totals in northern Maine could reach nearly 2 feet. Portland, Maine, is expected to get 3 to 5 inches of snow, while Burlington, Vermont, is forecast to get between 6 and 12 inches, and Bangor, Maine, is forecast to receive between 4 to 8 inches. Structures in Tuscumbia, Alabama, including one of the city’s middle schools, lost their roofs from strong winds, according to the town’s mayor. “There is a lot of damage downtown,” William Foster told CNN affiliate WAFF Sunday morning. Drones would arrive in the morning to assess the roofs and other damage caused by the storm, he said, while a team from the Red Cross would also be deployed. “There were no calls about major injuries,” the mayor added. “Most calls were for lack of power, oxygen.” The city government posted a statement on Facebook warning that downtown Tuscumbia “was directly impacted” by the sweeping storm and asked residents to avoid the area. CNN has reached out to the Tuscumbia Police Department and the Tuscumbia Utilities Department for more details. A rare level 4-of-4 for high risk of flooding rainfall was in place for more than 1.5 million people in parts of northwestern Tennessee and western Kentucky, according to the Weather Prediction Center. That threat level has now ended. Such weather events are issued on fewer than 4% of days per year on average, but are responsible for more than 80% of all flood-related damage and 40% of all flood-related deaths, research from the prediction center shows. The threat level is raised because the atmospheric setup for the storm is “quite unusual for mid-February” and could support rainfall rates up to 2 inches per hour in the heaviest storms, according to the center. Half a foot of precipitation could fall in the high-risk area where heavier bouts of rain essentially get stuck for an extended period, the center said. Almost no area could absorb that much rain without flooding, but recent storms have already soaked soils in this region and make the threat that much more serious. Communities from eastern Arkansas to West Virginia were under a level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall Saturday, the center said. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency in 10 counties and a state of preparedness in all 55 counties Saturday, while the National Guard has been deployed in Virginia to assist with recovery efforts. Floodwaters surged through the roadways in several cities throughout Simpson County, Kentucky. Elsewhere in the state, dozens of flooded roads were closed in Adair County, according to emergency management officials. This story has been updated with additional information.

      "Headline: A Black transgender woman’s testimony helped ratify the 14th Amendment. Then conservatives began attacking her identity\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/us/frances-thompson-transgender-memphis-massacre/index.html\n",
      "Summary: On a Friday in June, Frances Thompson swore an oath before a congressional committee and began to testify about what she’d experienced during a race riot in Memphis one month earlier. She told the committee how seven White men, including two police officers, forced their way into her home and stole her money and all her meager belongings before sexually assaulting her and her teenage housemate. In sharing her harrowing experience, Thompson quietly made history. She is believed to be the first Black transgender woman to testify before Congress. Thompson’s testimony in 1866 came at a critical time, as the nation weighed whether to expand equal constitutional protections to newly freed Black Americans. But it also came at a great personal cost – a decade after her landmark testimony, Thompson was cruelly outed, arrested for cross-dressing and forced to work in an all-male chain gang. Historians and advocates tell CNN they draw parallels between all that Thompson experienced as a Black trans woman and today’s anti-transgender political climate after President Donald Trump signed numerous executive orders targeting trans American minors’ right to access medical treatment and participate in school sports teams aligned with their gender identities.. Bryanna Jenkins, policy director at the Lavender Rights Project, which works to address what it calls a “crisis of violence” against the Black trans community, said in order to understand how to defend the civil rights of transgender Americans today, we need to examine the history and experiences of trailblazers like Thompson. “If we’re going to strategize and be honest about where we have to go,” she said, “we have to look back.” Exactly one year after the end of the Civil War, on April 9, 1866, Congress overrode President Andrew Johnson’s veto to enact the nation’s first civil rights law. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 declared freed Black Americans were citizens entitled to “full and equal benefit of all laws … as is enjoyed by white citizens.” Then the massacres began. On May 1, 1866, a White mob laid siege to the nascent Black community that had begun to thrive in Memphis, Tennessee. Despite the end of the war, many White people violently resisted the federal push for formerly enslaved Black Americans to have equal rights. In Memphis, tensions often ran high between Black Union soldiers and the city’s poorer White residents. After a skirmish between the soldiers and police, a local politician stoked a White mob into a frenzy by telling the men to “go ahead and kill the last damned one of the n***er race,” according to the 1866 congressional investigation into the massacre. “They are free, indeed,” the politician said, “but … we will kill and drive the last one of them out of the city.” For three days, the rioters – which included the city’s police – terrorized Black residents, indiscriminately murdering, raping and robbing people, according to the 1866 report. No one was spared. The mob attacked the sick and elderly and raped multiple women, according to the report. Rachel Hatcher, a 16-year-old girl, was shot and killed and her body burned in a fire.  The rioters then set fire to a home with women and children inside and shot them as they ran out. In the end, the White mob killed more than 40 people, injured dozens and destroyed countless homes, churches and businesses, according to the report. The attack would become known as the Memphis Race Massacre. In the days that followed, Congress dispatched federal agents and members of the Freedman’s Bureau – which had been founded to help the formerly enslaved transition into citizenship – to interview survivors and document what had occurred. Frances Thompson was “one of many women who got up that morning and walked to the congressional hearing and told her story,” historian Hannah Rosen said. Rosen’s book, “Terror in the Heart of Freedom,” details how White men weaponized sexual violence against Black women after the Civil War – and highlights the bravery of women like Thompson who shared their experiences. Investigators noted that Thompson used crutches and described herself as a “cripple” who had “cancer in (her) foot.” On the first night of the massacre, Thompson said the White men – including two police officers – entered her home and demanded that she and her 16-year-old housemate, Lucy Smith, make them dinner. “When they had eaten supper, they said they wanted some woman to sleep with. I said we were not that sort of women, and they must go,” Thompson testified. “They drew their pistols and said they would shoot us and fire the house if we did not let them have their way with us.” Thompson said she was assaulted and beaten so badly she remained in bed for days and was sick for two weeks. Lucy Smith, who was also attacked and assaulted, testified that she “thought they had killed me.” Newspapers published excerpts from the House report. Rosen said the brutality of the massacre, combined with the testimony of Thompson and the other women who were assaulted, horrified the nation. Then, later that summer, another White mob descended on a Black political rally in New Orleans, killing 34 Black residents and injuring more than 100 people. At the time, states were weighing whether to ratify the 14th Amendment, and the combined horrors of the back-to-back race massacres underscored the need for constitutional protections to ensure Black Americans had equal rights. The text of the 14th Amendment borrowed heavily from the language of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which declared all people born in the United States, except for Native Americans who did not pay taxes, to be US citizens, regardless of their race or “previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude.” The law’s language around “full and equal benefit of the law” was also adapted into the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. Rosen credits the bravery of Thompson and the other women who testified with helping to shift the national sentiment around the 14th Amendment. “Her impact isn’t direct, but she was part of the large numbers of people in Memphis … who showed enormous courage showing up to tell their story to congressional leaders who were not necessarily sympathetic,” Rosen said. “We can only assume she did that because they hoped it would have an impact, and they wanted their stories recorded, and they wanted the world to change.” Despite her bravery, Thompson was later forcibly outed as a transgender woman – and her life would ultimately end in tragedy. Not much is known about Thompson’s life until a decade after the massacre, when her name once again began to appear in newspapers. A decade after the end of the Civil War, the gains made during Reconstruction had already started to wane. Many Black residents had fled Memphis after the massacre, and the state took over the Memphis police department, Rosen said, because the officers “were seen as out-of-control ruffians … who had obviously been a key source of the violence.” In 1876, Thompson was still living in South Memphis when rumors began circulating that she was “cross-dressing,” a violation of a local ordinance. She was arrested and conservative newspapers – which had been instrumental in sowing discord before the massacres – reported that Thompson had been subjected to a medical exam and was “pronounced a member of the male sex.” Multiple articles used Thompson’s identity to try to undermine her testimony to Congress about the Memphis Massacre. But she remained defiant – even as officers forced her to take mugshots in both men’s and women’s clothes. She told police and local reporters that she’d lived her entire life as a woman and believed she was “of double sex.” Still, the city’s recorder fined Thompson $50 – the equivalent of around $1,000 today – and when she couldn’t pay, she was forced to work off the debt on an all-male chain gang. Thompson was paraded through the city and humiliated as she worked off her fine. After being released from prison, Rosen said Thompson’s neighbors went to check on her and found she was ill. They took her to a local hospital, where she later died. The historian said in many ways, 160 years later, the country appears to be echoing the same backlash that occurred after Black Americans made modest gains towards equality following Reconstruction – and vulnerable people, like trans Americans, are once again bearing the brunt. “History is repeating itself,” Rosen said, adding that she sees parallels in the “vilification of Black trans women in order to denigrate one’s political opponents,” and what Thompson experienced. Like the resistance to Reconstruction, Rosen said she believes the backlash we’re witnessing today is “a reaction to the very brief window of commitment to racial equality” that followed the 2020 murder of George Floyd. But if Thompson’s life story proves anything, Bryanna Jenkins said, it’s that trans people always have and will continue to be at the forefront of the push for civil rights in the United States. “Black trans women and Black trans folks, we’ve always been here, we’ve always contributed,” Jenkins said.\n",

      "Headline: A year after Navalny’s death, his widow urges ongoing fight for a ‘free’ Russia\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/world/alexey-navalny-death-anniversary-yulia-navalnaya-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of late Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny, has urged people to continue fighting for a “free, peaceful” Russia a year after he died in prison. “We know exactly what we are fighting for – a future Russia that Alexey dreamed of – free, peaceful, beautiful. It’s possible,” Navalnaya said in a video posted Sunday on her late husband’s YouTube channel. “Let’s do everything we can to make his dreams come true.” On February 16, 2024, Navalny, who had been incarcerated since 2021, died age 47. The Russian prison service said Navalny had “felt unwell after a walk” and “almost immediately” lost consciousness. But Navalnaya, along with former US President Joe Biden, has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being responsible for Navalny’s death. The Kremlin has rejected those allegations. On Sunday, long lines of people could be seen gathering near, and laying flowers on, the grave of the outspoken Kremlin critic in Moscow, according to video taken by the Associated Press (AP). Navalny’s parents, Anatoly and Lyudmila, were among the mourners who visited the snowy cemetery in southeast Moscow. The pair stood silently beside their son’s grave with Alla Abrosimova, Navalnaya’s mother. Navalnaya said she has spent the past year speaking publicly on the situation in Russia, continuing the work of her husband. Navalny was a thorn in Putin’s side, exposing corruption in high places and orchestrating some of the biggest anti-government protests seen in recent years. “I see how Alexey’s name inspires people all over the world. They realize that our country is not only war, corruption and repression. Russia is you and me. Those who are not silent. Those who continue to fight,” Navalnaya said in the video. Navalnaya has also announced the creation of the Alexey Navalny Award, which will be presented annually to young politicians launching the most impactful grassroots initiatives. It will be given out on the opposition leader’s birthday each year. In 2021, Navalny returned to Russia from Germany, where he had been treated after being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. On arrival, he was swiftly arrested on charges he dismissed as politically motivated. Mourners told AP on Sunday that paying their respects to Navalny was an act of “protest” in present-day Russia where the government has only ramped up efforts to stifle free speech. A young Moscow resident called Alexander described Navalny as someone who “fought the way no one” else did to change the country. Fellow resident Anastasia described the anniversary of his death as a “tough date” but said his supporters would “continue remembering him for a long time.” “There is no one like him anymore,” Anastasia told AP. Eighteen countries, including several European nations, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, said in a joint statement Sunday: “We reiterate that the ultimate responsibility for his death lies with the Russian authorities.” “One year on, Russia’s dire human rights record continues to deteriorate. The Kremlin crushes peaceful dissent, maintains a climate of fear and undermines the rule of law,” the statement read. “As we reflect on Navalny’s enduring legacy, we continue to stand with civil society and human rights defenders working tirelessly to build a better future for Russia in the face of immense personal risk,” it added.\n",

      "Summary: A young man from an isolated Indigenous tribe who approached a riverine community in Brazil’s Amazon returned voluntarily to his people less than 24 hours later, Brazilian authorities said. The encounter occurred around 7 p.m. local time Wednesday in Bela Rosa, a community along the Purus River in the southwestern Amazon. Footage obtained by The Associated Press shows him barefoot and wearing a small loincloth, seemingly calm and in good health as he carried two logs. Locals believe the man was asking for fire. Smartphone video of the encounter showed one resident trying unsuccessfully to show the man how to use a lighter. Officials from Brazil’s Indigenous affairs agency, Funai, arrived soon after and took him to a nearby facility. Funai said in a statement Friday that the young man returned to the forest on Thursday afternoon. It added that a team of health professionals was sent to assess if the young man had been exposed to any disease to which isolated Indigenous tribes have no immunity. They also said surveillance has been established to prevent people from reaching the isolated tribe’s location. As a policy, Brazil does not actively seek contact with these groups but instead establishes protected and monitored areas, such as Mamoriá Grande, near where the encounter occurred.\n",

      "Headline: Who is Friedrich Merz, Merkel’s rival and German election frontrunner?\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/europe/friedrich-merz-profile-germany-election-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Friedrich Merz, the 69-year-old veteran German politician with a hardline stance on migration and a love of aviation, is the favorite to become the country’s next chancellor in the federal election on February 23. But who is the old-school conservative who wants to rid his party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), of former leader Angela Merkel’s centrist legacy? His long-time rival’s decision to leave the top job in 2021 prompted Merz to come out of political hibernation and run for the party leadership. After two failed bids, he was eventually selected to lead the CDU in 2022. Now, he appears to have the chancellery within his grasp after the November collapse of Germany’s governing coalition – made up of the Social Democrats (SPD), Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the Greens – which paved the way for the snap election. If his party comes out on top, Merz stands to take the helm of a country mired in crises – although it may take weeks to form a governing coalition. He has pledged to reboot Germany’s large economy after years of uncharacteristic stagnation, crack down on migration, and lower taxes, all while attempting to wrestle back votes from the far right. Despite his party comfortably topping polls, his campaign has not been all smooth sailing. A dalliance with the hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) three weeks before the election drew criticism – and accusations he had breached the mainstream parties’ “firewall” against the AfD. Merz was born in 1955 into a conservative, Catholic family in the North Rhine-Westphalia town of Brilon, in central Germany, and joined the CDU’s youth wing while still in school. He entered politics full-time in 1989, when he was elected to the European Parliament at the age of 33. After serving one term as an MEP, Merz, a married father-of-three, was elected to the Bundestag – Germany’s parliament – and established himself as a leader in financial policy. In 2003, he famously argued that German tax rules should be simple enough to calculate on the back of a beer coaster. A growing feud with Merkel eventually pushed him to leave politics, however. Merz, who appealed to the CDU’s more traditionalist, right-wing faction, lost out to Merkel in a party leadership contest in 2000. Merkel’s leadership signaled a break from the CDU’s norm; she was its first female leader, with a Protestant – rather than Catholic – background and centrist leanings. The pair’s rivalry became more apparent in 2002, when Merz was pushed aside as leader of the opposition in the Bundestag in favor of Merkel. By late 2009, Merz had fully joined the private sector. He worked as a lawyer and senior counsel at the international law firm Mayer Brown, among other positions. These ventures made him a multi-millionaire, according to German business newspaper Handelsblatt. This background may have persuaded voters that Merz is a man who can do business; a desirable skill for anyone hoping to fix Europe’s largest economy, which contracted for a second year running in 2024. Nine years after he left politics, the announcement of Merkel’s resignation from Germany’s top job paved the way for Merz to re-enter. After two failed bids for CDU party leadership, in 2018 and 2021, he was selected to lead in 2022, cementing his political comeback. Merz’s desire to distance himself from Merkel’s legacy is clear. He has sought to bring the CDU further to the right than it was under Merkel, partly to try to stop voters turning to the far right, while advocating for a more pro-market economy. In an interview with German broadcaster ZDF in 2019, he described his predecessor’s “idle” leadership as like a “carpet of fog” over the country, and has said he sees her “open door” refugee policy during the 2015 migrant crisis as a grave error. Merkel, for her part, criticized Merz in a rare political intervention in January, after he pushed through an immigration bill with help from the AfD – now the CDU’s main rival. The bill was ultimately defeated by the German parliament. In an interview at his party congress in early February, however, Merz reiterated to CNN that working with the AfD was a non-starter. “They are against… everything (that) we are, what we build up in the Federal Republic of Germany. There is no co-operation with this party,” he said. His campaign for the chancellery has largely focused on bread-and-butter issues like tax cuts, deregulation and incentives to work. Merz drives a hard line on immigration and sees curbing irregular migration to Germany as the most pressing task if he is elected, according to German news magazine Der Spiegel. He has called for asylum seekers arriving from other European Union member states to be rejected at Germany’s land borders. Merz has criticized liberal welfare benefits and accused Ukrainian refugees of “social tourism” – a phrase he later apologized for using. Overall, he promises to slash welfare spending, telling The Economist in a rare sit-down interview in the lead-up to the election that he wants to avoid “paying people who are not willing to work.” Merz and the CDU support Germany’s continued military aid to Israel amid its war in Gaza, while also advocating for a two-state solution as the long-term goal. In a televised debate with Chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier this month, Merz expressed unease over US President Donald Trump’s proposal to “take over” Gaza, while also suggesting it remains to be seen “what is really meant seriously.” On the topic of sending aid to Ukraine, Merz has advocated a more hands-on approach than the outgoing SPD-led coalition. He supports the delivery of long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv – something Scholz’s government has refused for fear of drawing Germany into the conflict. “We are on the Ukrainian side because the attack is against all of us,” he told CNN. Merz was vague when questioned by The Economist on the issue of Germany’s defense spending, although he acknowledged that it would have to increase in the long run. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week reiterated his administration’s demand for NATO members to spend 5% of GDP on defense at a meeting with US allies in Brussels. Germany’s government last month said it had met NATO’s target to spend 2% of its GDP on defense after establishing a special fund in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine – yet this falls significantly short of the Trump administration’s demand. In his spare time, Merz is an amateur pilot, sometimes flying his own private plane – an expensive hobby for a man who once described himself to German tabloid Bild as “upper middle class.”\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/sport/michael-osullivan-obituary-irish-jockey-spt-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Irish jockey Michael O’Sullivan has died at the age of 24 as a result of the injuries he sustained in a fall during a race 10 days ago, the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board (IHRB) announced on Sunday. “Michael sadly passed away in the early hours of Sunday morning surrounded by his loving family in Cork University Hospital,” Dr. Jennifer Pugh, chief medical officer of the IHRB, which oversees horseracing in Ireland, said in a statement. “We extend our appreciation to the multidisciplinary teams who provided the best of medical care to Michael, both on the racecourse and in Cork University Hospital,” Pugh added. O’Sullivan, who was riding Wee Charlie for Gerard O’Leary, was one of three who fell at the final fence in a race at Thurles Racecourse in Ireland on February 6. He was treated on the racecourse before being airlifted to the intensive care unit at Cork University Hospital. In her statement, Pugh described O’Sullivan as “a pleasure to be around” due to his “dedication, modesty and kind nature.” “Michael’s success and his humility will have inspired many and I share the feeling of loss today with all those who knew him,” she said. Though still a young jockey, O’Sullivan had already achieved much success in his career, including winning the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2023. Figures from across the horseracing world and in Ireland paid tribute to that talent on Sunday. Ireland’s taoiseach (prime minister) Micheál Martin said on X, formerly known as Twitter, he was “deeply saddened to learn of the tragic death of jockey Michael O’Sullivan.” “A talented rider who inspired many,” he added. “My sincere sympathies go to Michael’s family, his friends and colleagues in the racing world.” Meanwhile, British jockey Harry Skelton said it was “absolutely devastating news to hear Michael O’Sullivan has passed away.” “My thoughts are with his family, friends,” he posted on X. “When you go that door to race you all want to come back in it together, his peg now sits empty for all the wrong reasons, thinking of all the Irish weighing room.” All races scheduled for today at Punchestown and the Point to Point fixtures at Knockanard, Nengh and Tinahel have been canceled as a mark of respect to O’Sullivan.\n",

      "Summary: OpenAI’s board of directors has formally rejected a $97.4 billion bid by Elon Musk and other investors to purchase the company. “OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk’s latest attempt to disrupt his competition,” OpenAI Board Chair Bret Taylor said in a statement posted to X on Friday. The statement marks the latest twist in a long-running feud between OpenAI and Musk over the ChatGPT maker’s planned restructuring. OpenAI was founded — by a group that included Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — as a non-profit research lab with a for-profit entity, but it is aiming to restructure in a way that could make fundraising easier and increase returns for investors and employees. Musk has criticized that plan as an abdication of OpenAI’s non-profit mission, and on Monday, a Musk-led group of investors offered to buy the company to return it to an “open-source, safety-focused force.” The bid could have led to a monumental shake-up in the AI industry and made Musk, owner of OpenAI competitor xAI, an even more powerful force in tech. But OpenAI quickly rebuffed the offer, with Altman posting to X on Monday: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Taylor, who also happened to lead the board of X (then Twitter) when Musk began his takeover bid for that company, said in his Friday statement on behalf of OpenAI’s board: “Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure (Artificial General Intelligence) benefits all of humanity.” Marc Toberoff, an attorney for the Musk-led investor group, said in a statement that the rejection was “no surprise” given Altman’s earlier statement, and disputed Altman’s claim that OpenAI is not for sale. However, he added the group was surprised to see the action coming from the board, “which has strict fiduciary duties to carefully consider the bid in good faith on behalf of the charity.” “They’re just selling it to themselves at a fraction of what Musk has offered,” Toberoff said. “Will someone please explain how that benefits ‘all of humanity?’” It’s not the first time Musk has tried to put up hurdles to OpenAI’s restructuring plan. Musk sued OpenAI in June 2024 but dropped that initial lawsuit after the company published a blog post that included several of Musk’s emails from OpenAI’s early days. The emails appeared to show Musk acknowledging the need for the company to make large sums of money to fund the computing resources needed to power its AI ambitions, which stood in contrast to the claims in his lawsuit that OpenAI was wrongly pursuing profit. Musk filed a new lawsuit in August 2024 and accused OpenAI of racing to develop powerful “artificial general intelligence” technology to “maximize profits.” Musk also accused the company of engaging in racketeering. OpenAI, meanwhile, has accused Musk of essentially being jealous that he was no longer involved in the startup, after he left OpenAI in 2018 following an unsuccessful bid to convince his fellow co-founders to let Tesla acquire it. In an interview with Bloomberg TV at the AI Summit in Paris on Tuesday, Altman said of Musk: “I wish he would just compete by building a better product.” CNN’s David Goldman contributed to this report.\n",

      "Headline: Singles in this city pay the most to live alone\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/business/rent-singles-tax-zillow/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Most people who live alone know they’re paying a premium compared to their friends who split rent with partners or roommates. But in no city is this “singles tax” more expensive than in New York City. In the city that never sleeps, singles pay an average of $20,100 more per year to live alone. That’s according to an analysis from real estate platforms StreetEasy and Zillow, which owns the StreetEasy brand. They calculated the additional cost a person is paying to live solo in a one-bedroom apartment rather than sharing that space with a partner. Couples who live together in a one-bedroom apartment in New York City save a combined average of $40,200 per year on rent, according to the analysis. Other cities with expensive rent, like San Francisco, San Jose, California and Boston, also come with a hefty singles tax — but paying to live alone in New York costs the most. Nationwide, the typical annual savings for a pair of cohabitating renters is $15,123. That’s more than $25,000 lower than the New York City average. “New York City is abundant with young people looking to live alone. People want to live there, and because the demand is so high, that is a major reason for the discrepancy,” said Emily McDonald, Zillow’s rental trends expert. “For a lot of people, it comes with a lot of value,” she added. When comparing New York City’s boroughs, couples who live together save the most money in Manhattan, where the average one-bedroom apartment rents for $4,200, according to the report. The report highlights how expensive rent has become in major cities. Nearly half of all renter households in the US paid more than 30% of their income towards housing costs in 2023, qualifying them as “cost-burdened,” according to the latest government data available. For those who are fed up with paying a premium for being partnerless, Zillow also calculated which major US cities have the lowest singles tax. Detroit takes the top spot. In that city, the average rent is $813, and couples save $9,753 annually for living together, meaning the singles tax is $4,876. El Paso, Cincinnati and Buffalo are among the other major cities where it is relatively more affordable to live alone in a one-bedroom apartment, according to Zillow. As home prices have continued to rise and average mortgage rates hover around 7%, McDonald said Zillow is seeing more families stay in the rental market longer in many cities, adding to the overall competition for rental units. But lately, rent growth across the country has begun to level off. According to a separate report from Zillow released earlier this month, January saw an increase of 0.2% in average rents in the US. The average month-over-month rent growth for this time of year before the pandemic was 0.3%. More than 41% of landlords also offered concessions to attract renters in January, a record high in Zillow data. Still, McDonald advised people who are weighing whether to live alone to carefully consider their budget. “Beyond just rent, you’re going to be paying utilities alone, internet alone,” she said. “Household essentials cost more when they’re not split.”\n",

      "Headline: US retail spending plunged last month, falling for the first time since August\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/economy/us-retail-spending-january/index.html\n",
      "Summary: American shoppers pulled back on their spending last month for the first time since August as stubborn inflation continued to bite and harsh weather curbed economic activity. Retail sales plunged 0.9% in January from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Friday. That’s down sharply from December’s upwardly revised 0.7% gain and well below economists’ expectations of a 0.4% decline. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. Shoppers reined in their spending across multiple categories last month. Specialty stores and auto dealers were hit hardest, with spending falling 4.6% and 3%, respectively. US stocks were mostly flat Friday morning at market open, with all three major indexes up just 0.1%. A key measure that excludes volatile components, referred to as the “control group,” was down 0.8% in January. Spending at restaurants, bars and department stores remained in positive territory last month. Sales at retailers and food establishments account for about a third of overall spending in the US. The American economy is driven by consumer spending, accounting for about 70% of economic output. Inflation is down considerably from the 40-year highs of summer 2022, but it has shown signs of getting stuck in recent months. That’s a big reason why the Federal Reserve is holding off on additional interest rate cuts, after delivering three consecutive cuts last year. Inflation could worsen if President Donald Trump keeps his promise of imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada as soon as March 1. The Trump administration is also weighing levying reciprocal tariffs in April. Most economists say Trump’s hefty duties would likely ramp up price pressures in the US, contrary to the Trump administration’s belief that foreign countries will pay for the tariffs. While the government’s retail figures are adjusted for seasonality, unusually cold weather in recent years has had an outsized impact on people’s spending behavior, typically in January. That means the latest figures might not be fully representative of the US consumer’s health. January’s decline also comes after a strong gain in the prior month. “The drop was dramatic, but several mitigating factors show there’s no cause for alarm,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an analyst note Friday. “Some of it can be chalked up to bad weather, and some to auto sales tanking in January after an unusual surge in December due to fat dealer incentives. Especially considering December was revised up strongly, the rolling average of consumer spending remains solid.” Last month was also when blazing wildfires ravaged Los Angeles, which may have kept Americans in the country’s second-largest city hunkered down. “We will need to wait until the February data to see if this is the start of a more cautious consumer trend or indeed whether it was simply a weather related pull back and we get a subsequent big gain,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, in commentary issued Friday. Friday’s report doesn’t move the needle for the Fed. Wall Street is still betting with near certainty that the central bank will stand pat at its March 18-19 meeting, according to futures, after central bankers paused rate cuts last month. That’s mostly because recent inflation data has come in hotter than expected and the job market is holding steady, with unemployment at a low 4%. For the Fed to begin cutting again, it would need to see either inflation back on track toward the Fed’s 2% target, the job market weakening more than expected, or even a combination of the two, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told congressional lawmakers this week during his semiannual testimony on monetary policy. The biggest wild card for the Fed this year is the Trump administration and its policies, such as stiff tariffs, mass deportations, deregulation and slashing the size of the federal government’s workforce. It’s not clear how those policies put together will ultimately affect the US economy. “My view is until we have more clarity, it’s going to be impossible to make a judgment about where our policy should go and how fast and at what pace, and so we’re just going to have to get more information before we’re going to be able to move,” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday at an event in Atlanta in reference to the Trump administration’s promises and actions. Bostic does not vote on policy moves this year.\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/sport/new-york-giants-minority-sale-spt-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: The New York Giants ownership is considering the sale of a minority stake in the franchise, the team confirmed on Thursday. The Giants did not outline the percentage of the stake potentially for sale, but did confirm they had acquired the services of an investment bank to explore the opportunity. “The Mara and Tisch families have retained Moelis & Company to explore the potential sale of a minority, non-controlling stake in the New York Giants,” the Giants said in a statement sent to CNN. “There will be no further comment in regard to the process.” The statement comes after the Sports Business Journal reported Thursday that the Giants were looking to sell up to 10% of the team, citing unnamed sources. Last year, the NFL voted in favor of allowing private equity firms to buy up to 10% of teams. John Mara and Steve Tisch, on behalf of their families, currently own 50% each of the Giants. The franchise was purchased by Tim Mara, John’s great grandfather, in 1925 for $500. In 1991, Steve Tisch’s father, Robert, became a co-owner after negotiating a 50% stake in the team. The franchise has been co-owned by the two families ever since. Last year, Forbes ranked the Giants as the fourth most valuable team in the NFL, estimating its worth to be $7.3 billion. Despite the team’s glittering history, current Giants fans have grown disgruntled by the lack of recent success. Last year, the team failed to retain superstar running back Saquon Barkley – who went to their division rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles, and recently won Super Bowl LIX – and wallowed to a 3-14 record. The Giants last won the Super Bowl in 2012 and have only had two playoff appearances since: the 2016 and 2022 seasons.\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/us/opossum-costco-chocolate-cake-nebraska/index.html\n",
      "Summary: A real estate agent in Omaha, Nebraska, recently got an unexpected houseguest – a hungry opossum who ate the entire tuxedo chocolate mousse cake she recently bought from Costco. Kim Doggett walked outside last Sunday to find her chocolate cake on the floor of her back porch, brown paw prints on her new beige couch and a panting opossum lying on top of it. Now fans have flooded Nebraska Wildlife Rehab, where the opossum was admitted on February 10, with messages of support for the viral “Cake Bandit” who ate an entire Costco cake. “We’ve all been there, girl,” one person said under the wildlife rescue service’s Facebook post. “I have also begun to (breathe) heavily after eating an entire cake by myself. Maybe not Costco but it definitely has happened more than once. I get it gurl. I get it,” another commenter said. Earlier that night, Doggett asked her son to take her homemade peanut butter balls outside to the deck, as their refrigerator was full. “We just (ran) out of room,” Doggett said. “And in the wintertime, it works out great, because you don’t have to try to slam everything in there. You can set it out on the back deck.” Upon opening the door, her son quickly shut it and refused to go back out. “There’s a possum on your couch,” Hayden Doggett, 22, said to her. His mom didn’t believe him at first. “I really thought he was messing with me, so I went over and I turned the light on, I opened the door, and I was like, ‘Oh my,’” Kim Doggett said. “And then I was like, ‘Oh, it ate the Costco cake.’ The whole thing almost was sitting on the ground next to the couch.” The two tried to shoo the opossum away, but with no luck, she began to consider whether the chocolate could have been poisonous to the animal. Kim Doggett then called the American Humane Society, which retrieved and transported the animal to be evaluated. Eating the entire cake likely saved the opossum’s life, Nebraska Wildlife Rehab said. The “Cake Bandit” is currently being treated for both her recent dietary habits and unrelated lead toxicity. “It appears that she was lucky to have been caught red-handed, because it allowed her to come to our hospital and get diagnosed with what can become a fatal condition in wildlife,” Laura Stastny, the group’s executive director, said in an email to CNN. Since her admittance, the organization has designed T-shirts with “Cake Bandit” on the front, and the back displaying the animal’s rehab admission note: “Opossum was brought in due to having eaten an entire Costco chocolate cake. He was panting a lot, however mobile and alert.” “We thought we’d celebrate the sweetest scandal of the week with a custom-designed Opossum Cake Bandit t-shirt that also supports our mission to save native wildlife and contribute to more success stories like hers,” Nebraska Wildlife Rehab said in a Facebook post. The opossum is expected to make a full recovery and will be returned to her natural habitat in a few weeks, Stastny said. “We are optimistic about her future release, but it will likely be toward the end of March or the beginning of April before she is released into the wild,” she added.\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/sport/jannik-sinner-three-month-ban-tennis-spt-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month ban from tennis to settle a case which has lingered over the sport for months after he twice tested positive for a banned substance, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced on Saturday. The men’s world No. 1 will be banned from February 9 to May 4 after twice testing positive for banned substance Clostebol in March 2024, meaning that he will be eligible to play in the French Open – the next grand slam on the calendar. Sinner had previously avoided suspension from competition with the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announcing in August that he wasn’t at fault for the positive tests. Two samples collected eight days apart at Indian Wells in March 2024 showed low levels of Clostebol, an anabolic steroid. In a statement posted on social media in August, Sinner said the positive tests stemmed from “inadvertent contamination of Clostebol” through treatment from his physiotherapist. The 23-year-old also said that his physio had been applying an over-the-counter spray to their own skin – not on Sinner – to treat a small wound. WADA then lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) following the decision made by an independent tribunal. Following its agreement with Sinner, WADA said it has now formally withdrawn its appeal to CAS. “WADA accepts that Mr. Sinner did not intend to cheat, and that his exposure to clostebol did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit and took place without his knowledge as the result of negligence of members of his entourage,” WADA said in Saturday’s statement. “However, under the Code and by virtue of CAS precedent, an athlete bears responsibility for the entourage’s negligence. Based on the unique set of facts of this case, a three-month suspension is deemed to be an appropriate outcome.” Following the outcome, the three-time grand slam winner accepted responsibility for the team around him. “This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year,” Sinner said in a statement sent by his agents to CNN. “I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA’s strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted WADA’s offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction.” When contacted by CNN on Saturday, the ITIA said that WADA’s outcome supports their original findings that the breach was unintentional. “The three-month outcome was only possible by agreement between WADA and the player,” the ITIA added. Sinner’s lawyer Jamie Singer said in a statement to CNN that he was “delighted that Jannik can finally put this harrowing experience behind him.” “WADA has confirmed the facts determined by the Independent Tribunal,” Singer added. “It is clear that Jannik had no intent, no knowledge, and gained no competitive advantage. Regrettably, errors made by members of his team led to this situation.”\n",

      "Headline: ‘White Lotus’ is expected to lure more tourists to Thailand. These are the locations featured on season 3 of the hit show\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/travel/thailand-white-lotus-season-3-locations-intl-hnk/index.html\n",
      "Summary: In recent years, no TV series has gotten viewers excited about luxury travel quite like “The White Lotus.” It’s easy to understand why. It’s got murder. Sexy scandals. Gorgeous beaches. And, perhaps most importantly, wealthy travelers behaving terribly. Seasons one and two of the satirical dark comedy-drama, written and directed by Mike White, were set in luxury hotels in two stunning places — Hawaii and Sicily, respectively. In both seasons, guests and employees experience a transformative week as the truths behind the characters’ seemingly idyllic lives are exposed. The third season of the Emmy-winning HBO show, which premieres on February 16, is expected to be spicier than ever as it takes viewers to another one of the world’s most popular destinations — Thailand. This season’s cast includes Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan, Jason Isaacs, Leslie Bibb, Walton Goggins, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger and Thailand’s very own K-pop superstar, Lalisa ‘Lisa’ Manobal. Season one fan favorite Natasha Rothwell will also be returning to reprise her role as spa manager Belinda. Expectations for this one are high. Over the last few months, fans of the show have been dissecting the trailers and trying to pinpoint the various locations, from Koh Samui, where most of the action takes place, to other popular destinations like Bangkok and Phuket. Thankfully, HBO has just released a list highlighting many of the locations that were used to create the stunning backdrop of season three, allowing travelers to create their own White Lotus-inspired journey. As Lalisa’s character “Mook” says in the trailer, “I hope you enjoy Thailand.” Koh Samui, located in the Gulf of Thailand, is the country’s second-biggest island after Phuket. Its white sandy shores are dotted with luxury hotels, a handful of which make an appearance in the show. Keeping with tradition, the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui is the real star of season three, standing in for the title character — the White Lotus Resort & Spa. (Both seasons one and two were filmed in Four Seasons properties.) According to HBO, we can expect to see plenty of scenes taking place in the resort’s luxurious pool villas, restaurants, outdoor landscapes and fitness areas. The “White Lotus” bar, however, can actually be found at another luxury property — it’s Anantara Lawana Koh Samui Resort’s Singing Bird Lounge. As for the hotel’s lobby, security station, driveway and jewelry store? You’ll have to head for the Thai hotel brand’s second resort on the island, Anantara Bophut Koh Samui. Other Samui resorts and attractions that HBO says featured in the new season’s trailer include Choeng Mon Beach, Am Samui Resort Taling Ngam, Wat Phu Khao Thong (a temple), the Dusit Dheva Cultural Center, Cape Fahn Hotel and the Pi Samui Beach Club and Restaurant. The nearby island of Koh Phangan’s Haad Rin Beach, home to Thailand’s famous Full Moon parties, also makes an appearance. Meanwhile, HBO says some arrival scenes were filmed at the stunning Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park — a popular day trip for Samui visitors. Some scenes for “The White Lotus” were shot on Thailand’s largest island, Phuket, in the Andaman Sea. If the return of season one favorite Belinda has you excited, you’ll want to head for the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort. Many of the spa manager’s scenes were actually shot there. “White Lotus” dinner scenes were filmed at yet another luxury hotel property — Rosewood Phuket’s Ta Khai restaurant. Other Phuket attractions highlighted by HBO that appear in the show’s trailer include Bangla Boxing, Ya Nui Beach, the Phuket Yacht Haven Marina and Café Del Mar. Additional arrival scenes were filmed at Ko Lawa Yai, which is off the coast of Phuket near Phang Nga Bay, says HBO. Meanwhile Bangkok’s grand dame, the historic Mandarin Oriental Hotel, also makes an appearance in the trailer. Ever since it was confirmed in early 2024 that the third season would be set in Thailand, much has been said about the inevitable impact the show will have on tourism growth. “We are honored to have amazing Thailand featured as the filming location for the highly anticipated upcoming season of ‘The White Lotus,’” said Tourism Authority of Thailand Governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool in a press release following the announcement. “The kingdom’s exotic natural beauty, rich historical sites and diverse landscapes are the perfect settings to share our fascinating culture, fantastic cuisine, top-notch wellness and luxury offerings, and most importantly our people and Thai hospitality.” Multiple tour companies and resorts have already put together “White Lotus” themed Thailand packages, while a source from Hotels.com tells CNN that searches are up 40% for Koh Samui ahead of season three. The island will likely see an even higher bump in the weeks to come. Season two of the “White Lotus” was set at the San Domenico Palace, a Four Seasons Hotel, in Italy and saw a 300% increase in searches after the show launched, according to Hotels.com. Meanwhile, the Tourism Authority of Thailand reports the country welcomed more than 35 million international travelers in 2024, generating over 1.8 trillion baht ($53.5 billion) in tourism revenue. This year, it aims to attract 39-40 million international visitors and generate 3 trillion baht in tourism revenue, which would mark a return to pre-pandemic arrival numbers. “The White Lotus” Season 3 premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/PT on HBO, with the episode available to stream on Max. HBO and Max, like CNN, are owned by the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.\n",

      "Headline: China’s animated blockbuster smashed box office records at home. Now it’s hitting Western cinemas\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/media/china-ne-zha-2-box-office-success-intl-hnk/index.html\n",
      "Summary: An unruly Chinese boy who battles dragons and defies destiny has made his way to Western cinema screens after smashing box office records in China. “Ne Zha 2,” an animated blockbuster loosely based on Chinese mythology, is now the world’s highest-grossing movie of all time in a single market, racking up a staggering $1.4 billion in ticket sales in China since its January 29 release. It dwarfs the previous record held by “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which netted $936 million in the United States and Canada in 2015. The Chinese production is also the first non-Hollywood film to break into the all-time global top 20 of highest-grossing films. The phenomenal success of “Ne Zha 2” – a rare bright spot in China’s otherwise sluggish box office amid a struggling economy – has sparked a wave of national pride and jubilation, with audiences, state media and officials rushing to celebrate the landmark achievement. For decades, China’s movie market had been dominated by Hollywood blockbusters. But in recent years, homegrown titles – in genres from action and sci-fi to romance and animation – have increasingly outpaced Western films, a pivot fueled by rising cultural pride, more sophisticated storytelling and rapid technological progress. And as censorship tightens and geopolitical tensions with the United States flare, it’s become all the more difficult for Hollywood to navigate political landmines in the once-lucrative market. China’s domestic film industry has pounced on the opportunity. Animation rooted in traditional Chinese folklore, enhanced with state-of-the-art special effects, has proven to be a winning formula. For a new generation of Chinese filmmakers and audiences, the reasoning is clear: If China’s own talent can deliver high-quality adaptions of the legends they grew up with, why rely on Western studios to tell Chinese stories? Following its record-breaking run in China, “Ne Zha 2” has headed overseas, with wide releases in Australia and New Zealand on Thursday and North America on Friday. It became an instant hit among the Chinese diaspora – many rushed to snap up presale tickets days in advance and lined up for its premieres. “Even those who weren’t previously interested in anime, like me, are drawn to this movie because of the enthusiasm and the glowing word of mouth in China,” said Summer Wang, a data analyst who attended the film’s premiere in Los Angeles. Stephanie Zhan, 30, a jewelry sales manager in Sydney, spent an hour getting to a cinema in a severe thunderstorm to watch “Ne Zha 2.” The audience, mostly of Chinese descent, erupted in applause at the end of the screening, she said. “It had a complete story arc with nuanced emotions, funny moments and the fight scenes were spectacular – on par with the epic battles in something like ‘The Avengers.’ It was truly impressive,” she said. “I feel hopeful about domestic films now.” The sequel to a 2019 box office champion, all the stars aligned for “Ne Zha 2” to become a smash hit. The film faced few serious competitors upon its release at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, a peak cinema-going time for the whole family in China. Drawing on a 16th-century novel, the film features characters familiar to Chinese audiences of all ages. But it also offers fresh takes that resonate with the young generation, said Xiaoning Lu, an expert on Chinese cinema at SOAS University of London. “It’s a very successful commercial film. On one hand, it’s got advanced animation technology, and on the other, it excels in storytelling. It’s family-friendly, fun to watch with a touch of rebellious spirit,” Lu said. “In fact, it’s a mixture of different formulas that came together and worked.” Born with a demonic fate and extraordinary powers, the protagonist, Ne Zha, is “ugly cute” and mischievous, unafraid to challenge heavenly authority and confront the gods who have manipulated power to suit their own ends. “The messages it conveys resonate with different audiences and reflect many of the challenges of our times, such as challenging the established structure, institution and authority; themes of family love and friendship; distrust of the system and authority; and identity confusion,” said Sabrina Qiong Yu, a film and Chinese studies professor at Newcastle University. “It’s like ‘chicken soup for the soul’ or a shot of excitement in the gloomy atmosphere of the era.” The film also invites open interpretation, with some nationalist viewers excited to spot “Easter eggs” they interpret as political metaphors mocking America — such as objects resembling US dollar signs, the Great Seal of the United States, the Pentagon and the coronavirus. Yu, who watched the movie in China, said she heard many audience members discussing these nationalist elements. “While I didn’t feel this strongly when watching the film, I do think it might have contributed to its box office success,” she said. Many recent Chinese blockbusters have capitalized on rising nationalist sentiment, achieving massive success. “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” a 2021 government-commissioned war flick, was previously China’s top-grossing title after taking the top spot from 2017 patriotic action movie “Wolf Warrior 2.” As it shattered box office records, “Ne Zha 2” quickly emerged as a triumph of China’s animation and film industries. The movie was made entirely in China, involving 138 animation companies and more than 4,000 crew, according to its end credits. Its director Yang Yu, a medical major turned animation filmmaker, told state broadcaster CCTV that he initially approached international production teams for some key scenes, but the results fell short of expectations. “Sure, they might be a top-tier studio, but they could be using third-rate staff on our project. So, after outsourcing, many of the shots didn’t turn out as we wanted, and we ended up bringing them back,” he said. Yang conceded that Chinese studios are still playing catch-up with top foreign counterparts in technologies and industrial processes, though the gap is closing. China’s animation industry has come a long way. In a market where generations of audiences grew up watching movies from Hollywood’s Disney and Pixar and Japan’s Studio Ghibli, a growing number of domestic animations have broken through in recent years, especially those championing traditional culture. It’s a similar story in other entertainment sectors. Last year, “Black Myth: Wukong,” a Chinese video game based on classical 16th-century novel “Journey to the West” and featuring cutting-edge graphics, became an international bestseller. As “Ne Zha 2” box office receipts surpassed Hollywood classics one after another, Chinese moviegoers rallied to support the film and push its ticket sales to new heights. On Chinese social media, users called on each other to hit the cinema – and even watch it multiple times. A trending hashtag on microblogging site Weibo compared the film’s rise through global box office ranks to “raising the national flag.” On Thursday night, the film hit a landmark 100 billion yuan ($13.7 billion) in ticket sales, overtaking “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” to become the third-highest-grossing animated film ever, just behind “Frozen 2.” State media and Chinese officials have piled praise on “Ne Zha 2,” hailing it as a prime example of China’s growing “cultural confidence.” China’s ambassador to Washington, Xie Feng, promoted the movie in multiple posts on X and in speeches. Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, called the film “a new bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the world and a new window on China for the world.” However, “Ne Zha 2” faces a major challenge in gaining a strong foothold in overseas markets, where it will compete with the newly released “Captain America: Brave New World.” And beyond the Chinese diaspora, it may struggle to connect with a broader international audience, viewers and experts say. “I do not see it having the same potential to transcend cultural boundaries and achieve significant box office success overseas as ‘Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon’ did at the start of this century,” said Yu, from Newcastle University. “But I could be wrong. Good luck to its overseas release.”\n",

      "Headline: Newly discovered fungus turns cave-dwelling spiders into ‘zombies’\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/science/zombie-spider-fungus-caves-gibellula/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Scientists in Europe have identified a previously unknown species of fungus that turns cave spiders into “zombies.” The fungus lures them out of their webs before instigating an untimely death and then uses the spiders’ corpses to spread its spores. The newly discovered species, named Gibellula attenboroughii, acts in a similar way as the zombie ant fungus, seemingly manipulating its prey to move to a more suitable spot for the fungus to spread, according to a study published January 24 in the journal Fungal Systematics and Evolution. But the way in which the fungus affects the arachnid’s brain is still a mystery, and a multitude of questions remain about the fungus’ evolutionary pathway and ecological impacts. “We know very well the ants, the wasps, and very few other examples. And now this is in a different family, so it’s a new origin of behavior manipulation,” said study coauthor Dr. João Araújo, a mycologist at the Natural History Museum of Denmark and an assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen. “It’s something really interesting that’s not super common in the parasitic world.” The finding opens up new research opportunities to better understand animal-controlling fungus and illuminates the diversity of fungi yet to be uncovered, researchers said. The newfound species is part of a larger branch of fungi that exclusively infects spiders. Researchers observed a different species of Gibellula (G. aurea found in Brazil) possibly manipulating spiders to move to the underside of leaves before death, as described in a November 2022 study coauthored by Araújo. However, the maneuver was not as strikingly evident as it is when G. attenboroughii targets cave spiders, Araújo said. So far, scientists have only observed G. attenboroughii infecting the spiders Metellina merianae and Meta menardi, both cave-dwelling orb weavers that are found in Europe. The first sighting of the peculiar fungus has a colorful backstory: In 2021, a television crew first spotted the fungus on an orb weaver spider while filming a show in an abandoned gunpowder storeroom at Castle Espie Wetland Centre in Northern Ireland’s County Down. The crew noticed that the spider placed itself in an exposed position before death, away from its web, suggesting the fungus had caused behavioral change. Further observations revealed more infected spiders in caves in both Northern Ireland and Ireland, all positioned in exposed areas of the roof or walls of the chambers, according to the study. “Most spiders that are web-building spiders very much like to stay on their web. They’re built to be good inside of a web, but then they’re actually quite bad at walking around on the ground,” said Dr. Jay Stafstrom, an expert on arachnid sensory ecology and postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “The fact that a fungus can infect something and then behaviorally alter that animal so that it then helps the fungus spread, I think it’s just very intriguing,” said Stafstrom, who was not part of the study. The researchers said they are unsure of the exact mechanics and inner workings of the fungus. But the team hypothesizes the fungus lures the spiders out of their lairs where they are exposed to circulating air currents, which helps spread its spores, said Araújo, who is also an honorary research associate at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in the United Kingdom. The authors have not yet identified which metabolites — compounds produced by the fungus that can interact with other organisms — G. attenboroughii is releasing in the brain of the host. More research is required to know the fungus’ ecological impact, but Araújo said he does not believe there is any cause for concern about the affected spider species. “Fungi have evolved many millions of years ago, more than 100 million years ago, and they have been coexisting with these spiders and other species of fungi and other insects,” Araújo said. “Actually, we can hypothesize that they keep the forest in balance,” he added, pointing to the case of the zombie ant fungi. Scientists have documented the lethal parasite regulating the insect population, Araújo said. Around 150,000 species of fungi have been formally documented, but it’s estimated that number is only around 5% of the diversity of fungus out there to be discovered, said Dr. Matthew Nelsen, an evolutionary biologist and research scientist at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History, who was not part of the new study. “This study draws attention to this challenge and will further inspire the community to work to close this gap,” Nelsen added in an email. The authors also noted the presence of mycoparasites observed eating the zombie spider fungus, “demonstrating that these spiders are important food sources for fungi, which in turn support other fungi. Together, this serves to shine a light on the complex and diverse world around us,” Nelsen said. The premise of zombie fungus can quickly turn into a horror story when reimagined as a sci-fi creature infecting humans, such as in the HBO series “The Last of Us,” said to have been inspired by the zombie ant fungus. (HBO shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.) Since this newly discovered fungus only affects spiders, humans need not worry about Gibellula attenboroughii, Nelsen said. “While there are absolutely some cave-dwelling fungi that are problematic for humans, this is part of a group of fungi that only infects spiders. Jumping to humans would require it to evolve tolerance to our warm body temperature and to circumvent our immune system, both of which serve as strong defenses against most fungi,” he added. Araújo said he and his team plan to continue studying the group of fungi that infects spiders to understand how these species are related, their origins, how they evolved, and more. Further understanding of these fungi could eventually lead to potential application in crop protection or even human medicine. “Imagine, (with) a fungus that can control the behavior of a spider, which metabolites they’re releasing in the brain of this spider,” Araújo said. “This could be something really revolutionary for Alzheimer’s and degenerative diseases and the ones that affect the brain. So maybe there’s hope there.”\n",

      "Headline: Weeks from homecoming, Boeing Starliner astronauts want to set the record straight\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/science/boeing-starliner-astronauts-stuck-space/index.html\n",
      "Summary: NASA’s Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore — the two astronauts who launched on Boeing Starliner’s first crewed test flight and have been in low-Earth orbit since June — want to set the record straight: They aren’t stranded on the International Space Station, and they weren’t abandoned. The duo made the remarks in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday when asked about claims from President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk that the astronauts were left high and dry by the prior administration. “That’s been the rhetoric. That’s been the narrative from day one: stranded, abandoned, stuck — and I get it. We both get it,” Wilmore said. “But that is, again, not what our human spaceflight program is about. We don’t feel abandoned, we don’t feel stuck, we don’t feel stranded.” Wilmore added a request: “If you’ll help us change the rhetoric, help us change the narrative. Let’s change it to ‘prepared and committed.’ “That’s what we prefer,” he said. Williams and Wilmore have always maintained they have not been stuck on the space station, but their comments mark a rare, vocal contradiction of the president from members of the US astronaut corps. Williams also reiterated a sentiment she has expressed on several occasions, including in interviews conducted before she left Earth. “Butch and I knew this was a test flight,” she told CNN’s Cooper, acknowledging the pair has been prepared for contingencies and understood that the stay in space might be extended. “We knew that we would probably find some things (wrong with Starliner) and we found some stuff, and so that was not a surprise,” she said. In late January, Musk said the Biden Administration had left the two astronauts “stranded” and said Trump had asked SpaceX to step in to rescue them. “The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so,” Musk’s post reads. “Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.” Trump also weighed in, posting on his Truth Social platform that Williams and Wilmore were “virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration.” But NASA had already put such a plan in place in August — well before Musk or Trump mentioned it — when the agency asked SpaceX to return Williams and Wilmore from the International Space Station as part of its Crew-9 mission. A delay in that departure was then announced in December because mission teams said they needed more time to prepare a new SpaceX vehicle. NASA said on Tuesday that it may bring Wilmore and Williams home a couple weeks sooner, however, after opting to change the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule it will use to launch the Crew-10 mission. The Crew Dragon Endurance will carry staff to the space station to replace Williams and Wilmore and their teammates, NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, as soon as March 12 “pending mission readiness.” NASA made no indication the schedule change was prompted by a directive from Trump. Presidents are not typically involved in space station matters. The crew rotation schedule is meticulously managed by NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian space agency that controls half of the space station. The Crew-10 mission includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov. After Williams and Wilmore arrived at the orbiting outpost in June, NASA and Boeing spent weeks attempting to pinpoint the cause of propulsion issues and gas leaks that plagued the first leg of the astronauts’ trip aboard the Starliner spacecraft. Ultimately, space agency officials deemed Starliner too risky for the astronauts’ return flight. The pair, who had been slated to spend about a week on the station during the Boeing Starliner mission, then joined the official space station crew and became part of its staff rotation. Williams and Wilmore are on track to return home on SpaceX’s Crew-9 capsule, the Crew Dragon Freedom, which reached the orbiting laboratory in September with two seats left empty for the veteran astronauts. The new launch date for Crew-10 put the astronauts’ planned return days ahead of schedule, as the space agency previously said it was targeting late March.\n",

      "Headline: Largest celestial object of its kind discovered in the distant universe\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/science/distant-giant-quasar-jet/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Astronomers have spied a monster radio jet in the distant universe that’s twice the width of the Milky Way galaxy. The ancient object formed when the universe was less than 10% of its current age of 13.8 billion years, according to a new study. “This is the largest radio jet seen thus far in the early Universe,” said lead author Anniek Gloudemans, a postdoctoral research fellow at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab, in an email. Until now, these faraway colossal radio jets released not long after the big bang have been elusive, mostly escaping detection, and how they are created remains an enigma, according to Gloudemans. “Their absence has previously been attributed to the cosmic microwave background (leftover radiation from 13.8 billion years ago), which diminishes the radio light of such distant objects,” she said. Most giant galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their centers. These central engines possess incredibly strong gravitational fields, gobbling up anything that strays too close. Funneling all that material causes some black holes to unleash an extraordinary amount of energy that scientists believe fuel the formation of a quasar — the brightest known objects in the universe. The luminous cores of distant, ancient galaxies, quasars expel jets of energetic matter. With the help of two powerful radio telescopes, astronomers spotted the gigantic two-lobed jet, which spans at least 200,000 light-years. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, which is 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). A study detailing the find was published February 6 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. By using telescopes to peer into the distant universe and study the phenomena observed there, astronomers can essentially see back in time. The discovery of the huge radio jet is providing a window into the early days of the universe, shedding light on when the first jets formed and how they shaped galaxies over time. The quasar that produced the two-lobed radio jet formed when the universe was less than 1.2 billion years old, or 9% of its current age, and it has some oddball traits. Astronomically speaking, the quasar, which weighs 450 million times the mass of our sun, is considered to be smaller than typical quasars, which can reach masses that are billions of times heavier than our star. “This seems to indicate that you don’t necessarily need an exceptionally massive black hole … to generate such powerful jets in the early Universe,” Gloudemans said in a statement. The double-sided jet is also asymmetrical in multiple ways, including the distances it spans away from the quasar, as well as its brightness, “which seems to indicate that an extreme environment is affecting the lobes,” Gloudemans said. An international team of astronomers first identified the radio jet while using the Low Frequency Array, or LOFAR, Telescope, a network of radio telescopes throughout Europe. Then, the researchers carried out follow-up observations in different wavelengths of light, such as near-infrared using the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument on the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii as well as visible light with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas. Together, the different bands of light helped the team piece together details about the large jet and the quasar, named J1601+3102, that produced it. “We were searching for quasars with strong radio jets in the early Universe, which helps us understand how and when the first jets are formed and how they impact the evolution of galaxies,” Gloudemans said in a statement. “It’s only because this object is so extreme that we can observe it from Earth, even though it’s really far away. This object shows what we can discover by combining the power of multiple telescopes that operate at different wavelengths.” Discovering a large radio jet in the distant universe suggests there are more waiting to be found, Gloudemans said, and the team is planning more observations to better understand the unusual environment around this particular quasar. Some of the biggest remaining questions include what factors lead to the creation of powerful radio jets. “There are around a thousand quasars known at this epoch and even earlier in the Universe, so even though they are rare, we definitely know quite a few,” Gloudemans said.“The quasars become extremely luminous by friction from gas and dust falling into the supermassive black hole. In the case of this quasar, part of the material has been launched in the form of two jets. We think that these strong radio jets form in roughly 10% of the quasars. Jets have been found even earlier in the Universe, but never of this monster size.” A separate team of astronomers, also using LOFAR, announced last fall the detection of Porphyrion, a gargantuan pair of jets spanning a whopping 23 million light-years — that’s 115 times more massive than the newly discovered two-lobed radio jet. But unlike the jet formed by J1601+3102, Porphyrion was found 7.5 billion light-years away from Earth in what’s called the “nearby” universe, rather than the early universe, according to the report published in September. Jets as enormous as Porphyrion would be difficult to detect in the early universe because leftover radiation from the big bang drowns out the radio light released by the jets, Gloudemans said. However, astronomers have long questioned whether long, powerful jets could be spotted in the distant universe because the black holes responsible for them behaved differently in the early universe and were less massive, said Martijn Oei, a postdoctoral scholar in observational astronomy at the California Institute of Technology and the lead author of the September study on Porphyrion. Oei was not involved in the new study. “What is exciting is that these authors show that quasars at times when they were less massive than they are today could still generate powerful and long jets,” Oei said in an email. “The Universe was much smaller than it was at Porphyrion’s time, so in a relative sense the contrast is less big! This is an impressive find, and shows that black holes affected the Universe with magnetism, heat and cosmic rays beyond the boundaries of their own galaxies already about a billion years after the Big Bang.”\n",

      "Headline: Record-breaking ‘ghost particle’ detected in the Mediterranean Sea\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/science/energetic-neutrino-particle-detection/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Astronomers using a giant network of sensors, still under construction at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, have found the highest-energy cosmic “ghost particle” ever detected. The neutrino, as the particle is formally known, is 30 times more energetic than any of the few hundreds of previously detected neutrinos. These tiny, high-energy particles from space are often referred to as “ghostly” because they are extremely volatile, or vaporous, and can pass through any kind of matter without changing. Neutrinos, which arrive at Earth from the far reaches of the cosmos, have almost no mass. The particles travel through the most extreme environments, including stars, planets and entire galaxies, and yet their structure remains intact. An analysis of the neutrino authored by the KM3NeT Collaboration, which includes more than 360 scientists from around the world, was published Wednesday in the journal Nature. “Neutrinos … are special cosmic messengers, bringing us unique information on the mechanisms involved in the most energetic phenomena and allowing us to explore the farthest reaches of the Universe,” said study coauthor Rosa Coniglione, KM3NeT deputy spokesperson and researcher at Italy’s INFN National Institute for Nuclear Physics, in a statement. The record-breaking neutrino, named KM3-230213A, had the energy of 220 million billion electron volts. This astonishing amount makes it around 30,000 times more powerful than what the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, Switzerland — known for supercharging particles to nearly the speed of light — is capable of, according to the study authors. “One way I like to think about it is that the energy of this single neutrino is equivalent to the energy released by splitting not one uranium atom, or ten such atoms, or even a million of them,” said study coauthor Dr. Brad K. Gibson in an email. “This one little neutrino had as much energy as the energy released by splitting one billion uranium atoms … a mind-boggling number when we compare the energies of our nuclear fission reactors with this one single ethereal neutrino.” The particle provides some of the first evidence that such highly energetic neutrinos can be created in the universe. The team believes the neutrino came from beyond the Milky Way galaxy, but they have yet to identify its exact origin point, which raises the question of what created the neutrino and sent it flying across the cosmos in the first place — perhaps an extreme environment such as a supermassive black hole, gamma ray burst or supernova remnant. The groundbreaking detection is opening up a new chapter of neutrino astronomy, as well as a new observational window into the universe, said study coauthor Paschal Coyle, KM3NeT spokesperson and researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique – Centre de Physique des Particules de Marseille in France. “KM3NeT has begun to probe a range of energy and sensitivity where detected neutrinos may originate from extreme astrophysical phenomena,” Coyle said. Neutrinos are difficult to detect because they don’t often interact with their surroundings — but they do interact with ice and water. When neutrinos interact directly with the detectors, they radiate a bluish light that can be picked up by a nearby network of digital optical sensors embedded in ice or floating in water. For example, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole includes a grid of more than 5,000 sensors embedded in the Antarctic ice. The detector has been operating since 2011, and has discovered hundreds of neutrinos. Scientists have been able to trace some of them back to their cosmic sources, such as a blazar or the bright core of an active galaxy. An international team conceived the idea of a network of detectors in the early 2010s — known as the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope, or KM3NeT — that might be able to pick up neutrinos in the deep ocean. Installation of the network began in 2015. The KM3NeT made the record-breaking detection on February 13, 2023, when the particle lit up one of its two detectors. ARCA, or the Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the Abyss, rests at a depth of 11,319 feet (3,450 meters), while ORCA, or Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss, is at a depth of 8,038 feet (2,450 meters) at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The ARCA detector, off the Sicilian coast near Capo Passero, Italy, was designed to pick up on high-energy neutrinos, while ORCA, near Toulon in southeastern France, is dedicated to the search for low-energy neutrinos. The KM3NeT, which includes a grid of sensors anchored to the seabed, remains under construction. But enough detectors were in place to pick up on the high-energy neutrino, the study authors said. The ARCA detector was operating with just 10% of its planned components in place when the particle traced a nearly horizonal path through the entire telescope, setting off signals in more than one-third of the active sensors. The detector recorded over 28,000 photons of light produced by the charged particle. If the energy within the neutrino was converted for our understanding of everyday objects, it would amount to 0.04 joules, or the energy of a ping-pong ball dropped from a height of 3.28 feet (1 meter), said study coauthor Aart Heijboer, physics coordinator of KM3NeT and professor at the Dutch National Institute for Subatomic Physics, or NIKHEF, and University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. That amount could power a small LED light for about 1 second, he said. “So it is not a large amount of energy for every-day objects, but the fact that such an analogy with the every-day world is even possible is remarkable in itself. All this energy was contained in one single, elementary particle,” Heijboer said in an email. On a particle scale, the neutrino was considered ultra-energetic, with roughly 1 billion times 100 million times the energy of visible light photons, according to the study authors. Detecting neutrinos on Earth allows researchers to trace them back to their sources. Understanding where these particles come from could reveal more about the origin of mysterious cosmic rays, long thought to be the primary source of neutrinos when the rays strike Earth’s atmosphere. The most highly energetic particles in the universe, cosmic rays bombard Earth from space. These rays are mostly made up of protons or atomic nuclei, and they are unleashed across the universe because whatever produces them is such a powerful particle accelerator that it dwarfs the capabilities of the Large Hadron Collider. Neutrinos could inform astronomers about where cosmic rays come from and what launches them across the universe. Researchers believe something powerful unleashed the newly found neutrino, such as a gamma-ray burst or the interaction of cosmic rays with photons from the cosmic microwave background, which is leftover radiation from the big bang 13.8 billion years ago. During the study, the authors also identified 12 potential blazars that may be responsible for creating the neutrino. The blazars are compatible with the estimated direction the particle traveled from, based on data collected by the detectors and cross-referenced data from gamma-ray, X-ray and radio telescopes. But more research is needed. “Many cosmic-neutrino detections fail to show strong correlations with catalogued objects, perhaps indicating source populations that are very distant from Earth, or hinting at an as-yet-undiscovered type of astrophysical object,” said Erik K. Blaufuss, research scientist and particle astrophysicist in the department of physics at the University of Maryland, College Park, in an accompanying article. Blaufuss was not involved in the study. “Although a full understanding of the origins of this event will take time, it remains an extraordinary welcome message for KM3NeT,” he said.\n",

      "Headline: ‘The greatest product placement ever’: How a TV show changed an industry\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/travel/the-love-boat-how-a-tv-show-transformed-cruise-industry/index.html\n",
      "Summary: From steam-powered ships, to mega-liners, the cruise industry has been through quite a transformation over the years. And the market has skyrocketed. Back in 1970, an estimated 500,000 people went on a cruise holiday. That figure had jumped to five million by 1997. So what brought about this sudden surge in interest? According to industry experts, it was mainly down to a certain TV show with a catchy theme tune. “Come aboard, we’re expecting you!” Produced by TV legend Aaron Spelling, ”The Love Boat” first aired in 1977 and went on to become one of the most successful shows in TV history during its decade-long run. The program, which is still available on streaming services such as Paramount Plus, partnered with Princess Cruises, and episodes were filmed aboard various Princess Cruise ships, the Pacific Princess and Island Princess being the most notable. Based on a non-fiction book written by former cruise director Jeraldine Saunders, “The Love Boat” centered around ship captain Merrill Stubing (played by Gavin MacLeod) and his on-board crew, while different guest actors played passengers each episode. The show, which spawned several spin-offs, has since been described as “the greatest product placement” ever, serving as a complete introduction to cruising for many of its avid viewers. “‘The Love Boat’ really created the cruise industry,” Michael L. Grace, who worked as a scriptwriter on the program during the 1980s, told CNN Travel in 2022. “Because you had 50 million people watching, and they all wanted to go on a cruise.” Several modern cruise lines existed when the show began, including Princess, founded in 1965 with a single ship cruising to Mexico. Royal Caribbean had launched in 1968, and Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972. But the cruising demographic was very different to what it is now. Although cruise companies were apparently keen to attract younger passengers, many people simply didn’t know much about cruising, and those who did had a very specific idea of it. “Back in the day, people would say cruising was for the nearly dead or newlywed,” says cruise journalist Carolyn Spencer Brown, chief content officer for Cruise Media, LLC. “So when ‘The Love Boat’ came on and showed people of all ages and races having fun and being lively on a cruise ship, that opened up cruising to a world that didn’t really know it existed.” Each week, tens of millions of people around the world would tune in to follow the exploits of Captain Stubing, Dr. Adam Bricker (Bernie Kopell), cruise director Julie McCoy (Lauren Tewes), bartender Isaac Washington (Ted Lange) and the captain’s daughter Vicki, played by Jill Whelan, and suddenly going on a cruise soared to the top of many a wish list. The passengers “would come on the ship,” Grace says of the formula for the hour-long show. “They’d have a problem. Then the problem is solved and they all come together again. [The episodes] were like small movies.” The launch of the “The Love Boat” came at a time when the vast majority of cruise ships on the water were former liners that had been converted. There were few new ships in service. However, this quickly changed when demand shot up thanks to the success of the show. The show “did so well that Princess Cruises were selling out their ships,” cruise historian Peter Knego tells CNN Travel. “And that led to the first boom of new cruise ship building in the early 1980s.” The fact that scenes from “The Love Boat” were occasionally filmed aboard real-life cruises, with the passengers serving as extras, only added to the appeal. “So many cruise lines want to create experiences for you that you probably couldn’t create on your own,” notes Spencer Brown. Becoming an extra on a popular TV show “certainly qualifies as something that doesn’t happen to most people.” Keen to strike while the iron was hot, existing cruise lines began building brand-new purpose-built cruise ships in order to cater to this fast-growing market, while new companies emerged like Celebrity Cruises, founded in 1988. “Back then, to build new cruise ships, that was a big deal,” says Knego. During the 1980s, almost 40 new cruise ships were constructed, including Tropicale, from Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Princess, Princess Cruises’ first purpose-built cruise ship. Royal Princess “had new features like balconies, which were pretty rare with mainstream cruising,” he adds. As more cruise lines emerged and began competing with each other, cruising became more affordable, expanding the market even further. “The Love Boat” may also have played a part in the heavy entertainment focus we see on modern-day cruise ships. Outlandish musical performances were often featured on “The Love Boat,” and they proved to be a big hit with viewers. During one of the show’s specials known as “The Love Boat Follies,” iconic stage and screen stars Della Reese, Ethel Merman, Carol Channing and Ann Miller sing a rendition of “I’m The Greatest Star” from the 1968 musical “Funny Girl” together. “It was very spectacular,” says Grace, who is working on a book about the impact of “The Love Boat.” “And what was so strange is, when they would flash back to the people watching in the audience, it was like a small little club. But the stage was the size of a West End theater.” Off screen, the Island Princess and its sister ship Pacific Princess, the two ships primarily used for filming towards the start of the series, held main stage production shows that became hugely popular with cruising fans. This led to the introduction of some grand new features on cruise ships in later years. “Princess and other cruise lines went on to build ships with state-of-the-art showrooms with huge stages, sound and lighting effects that are now standard on modern cruise ships,” says Knego, adding that the modern atriums seen on cruise ships today can also be traced back to “The Love Boat” ships. “The two deck lobbies with the grand staircase that was replicated for the studio shoots were early versions of the big atriums that are now popular features on modern cruise,” he says. Romance was understandably a very important factor in “The Love Boat.” While the relationship plots certainly kept viewers entertained, Spencer Brown stresses that this focus was also beneficial when it came to maintaining the notion that “cruises really are quite romantic.” “For a long time, Princess had all sorts of enhanced amenities that were pointed to romance,” she adds. “They really embraced this concept all the way through. You could have a balcony, sunset dinners, and rose petals strewn on your bed. All of these lovely, romantic things.” Long-time cruise enthusiast Judi Patterson, who met her husband Andy when he was working on board another cruise ship, P&O’s SS Oriana, was a fan of “The Love Boat,” but says her own cruising experiences were very different to what was portrayed on screen. The show “bears no resemblance to reality,” says Patterson. “But it was fun. I don’t know if people actually believe that that’s what happens [on cruise ships]. “It was fun to watch and think that these things might possibly happen.” “The Love Boat” reruns were still airing around the world years after its last episode, and the show’s fan base has remained incredibly loyal. Spencer Brown, who also met her now husband on board a cruise ship – the couple even got engaged on a cruise – believes that the partnership between “The Love Boat” and Princess Cruises has been the key to its longevity. “They truly embraced each other in a way that was really genuinely heartfelt,” she says. “The cast members became such a part of the cruise line, and they still are.” Princess Cruises often holds reunion cruises, with the actors from “The Love Boat” appearing as special guests. Last year, Jill Whelan — now Celebrations Ambassador for Princess Cruises — Bernie Kopell, Ted Lange and Fred Grandy (who played Gopher) reunited for a seven-day trip. Ezra Freeman, the bartender who appeared on short-lived reality show “The Real Love Boat,” which aired on CBS in 2022, will be joining the cast for the cruise, according to a press release issued by Princess Cruises. Knego, who has attended previous reunion cruises, says that he’s often struck by the strength of the fan’s love for the show and its stars. “People stand in line for hours just to get their picture taken with cast members,” says Knego. The cast “sign autographs and it’s quite a wonderful situation to this day.” MacLeod was a regular on the popular cruises until his death in 2021. “People always ask us why ‘The Love Boat’ was so popular and I always say it’s because it gave people something to dream about,” the actor said back in 2015. “They could dream about being out on the open seas on a cruise and discovering the worlds’ greatest destinations, dreaming about love and of course happy endings since the shows always ended on a high note. I’m proud to have played a role in the growth of the cruise industry.” Now a billion-dollar industry, cruising has evolved considerably since “The Love Boat.” According to cruise tracking website Cruisemapper, there are currently over 2,000 cruise ports across the world. More than 100 new ships were built during the 1990s, with most of them significantly bigger than the vessels that featured on the show. Royal Caribbean’s MS Sovereign of the Seas, considered to be the first mega ship, with a passenger capacity of 2,850, took its maiden voyage in 1998, while Disney Cruise Line was established that same year. At present, Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas, a 20-deck ship and a crew of 2,350, is the current record-holder for world’s biggest ship. While the Covid-19 pandemic undoubtedly devastated the cruise industry, things have bounced back considerably in the years since then, with at least 14 new ships expected to enter service in 2025 alone. “To me, the cruise industry is almost a victim of its success,” says Knego, who runs YouTube channel MidShipCinema, which is dedicated to old and new cruise ships. “Because the mainstream cruise ships now carry up to 5,000 people and they’re absolutely massive. “They don’t have the same kind of intimacy that you had back when ships only carried 800 or maybe 1,200 people like the Love Boats.” However, there are various cruise companies that offer smaller ships for those keen for a more Love Boat-style cruising experience. Patterson and her husband have taken many trips with leading small-ship cruise line Viking. “We only travel on small ships now,” she says, noting that it’s slightly more expensive to travel on more modestly sized ships. “We had our turn on the bigger ones.” Pacific Princess and Island Princess, the original Love Boats, have been scrapped in recent years. Knego managed to photograph the Island Princess during its final days at a scrapyard in India and was able to rescue a few of the furnishings and ornaments, including a bronze mermaid sculpture and some of the furniture from the lobby area of the ship. In 2022, another Princess ship, the Regal Princess, took center stage, albeit on a very different format, when it appeared in “The Real Love Boat.” “It’s good for the cruise industry,” Spencer Brown said of the series at the time, noting that a reality show was “a pretty radical reinterpretation” from the original show. The most recent “Love Boat” themed cruise, which was held on board Princess Cruises’ 330-meter Enchanted Princess last year, featured meet-and-greets, menus inspired by the show and episode screenings. “Sailing with our fans brings us so much joy…,” Whelan said in a statement. “Taking us back to where it all began – on a Princess Cruise.” This article was first published in 2022 and updated in 2025.\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/travel/airbus-a321xlr-single-aisle-plane-transatlantic/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Nashville’s honky-tonks are going to get a little busier in April. That’s when Aer Lingus launches its first nonstop flight to the country music capital from Ireland, a lesser-known hotbed of country music fans. The new flight to Nashville from Dublin is possible with a new, longer-range plane from Airbus: the A321XLR, or “Extra Long Range.” The derivative of the popular A321neo that debuted in 2017 can fly further than any other single-aisle plane on the market. Airbus also says it burns 30% less fuel per seat than previous-generation aircraft. “It allows us to go to cities that we would not be able to take the risk on with a wide-body,” said Reid Moody, chief strategy and planning officer at Aer Lingus, referring to the twin-aisle aircraft such as the Airbus A330 or Boeing 787 that are common on transatlantic flights. The Irish carrier already flies two A321XLRs and plans to add four more by the end of the year. Airlines around the world are clamoring for the new plane. Aer Lingus and its Spanish peer, Iberia — both are owned by European airline conglomerate International Airlines Group (IAG) — already fly the A321XLR, and Airbus has firm orders for more than 500 of the model, data from aviation analytics firm Cirium shows. Air Canada, American Airlines, Qantas Airways and United Airlines are among those awaiting their first XLR. Single-aisle planes across the North Atlantic are not new. Boeing’s 757 has plied the skies between North America and Europe for decades. The aircraft, however, is old. The last plane rolled off the production line in Everett, Washington, in 2004. The remaining airlines that fly the 757, including United, are eager to replace them with the new, fuel-sipping XLRs. And others, such as Aer Lingus, want the new Airbus model to expand their transatlantic map to new cities. The XLR, once it replaces older 757s, should allow airlines to bypass major hubs on either side of the Atlantic and open new, nonstop, transatlantic routes to smaller cities. “We’re going to open up 10 to 12 new cities in Eastern Europe (and) North Africa out of Newark and (Washington) Dulles,” United CEO Scott Kirby said on The Air Show podcast in June. “We’re excited about it.” While Kirby didn’t reveal just what cities United is considering, its recent expansion plans hint at outside-the-box destinations, at least from the United States, such as Bilbao, Spain, and Nuuk, Greenland. United expects its first of 50 A321XLRs in early 2026. American Airlines is also eyeing Europe with its coming XLRs. “We are looking at new, secondary Spain, Portugal, UK, anything in range — France, Germany, Scandinavia, all these smaller destinations that we think a wide-body just isn’t well-suited for,” Brian Znotins, who leads network planning at American, told The Points Guy in November. American’s first XLR, which is due later this year, will initially be used on premium transcontinental flights between New York and both Los Angeles and San Francisco. In addition to expansion opportunities, travelers could also see airlines using their XLRs to add extra flights on routes that might have only one today. Or the plane could be used to extend a seasonal route; for example, one that flies only during the summer, to year-round status by flying during the lower-demand winter. Just how many new transatlantic and other routes the XLR will unlock is an open question. Safety modifications required by European regulators added weight to the plane. It’s widely acknowledged that the changes have reduced the estimated range of the jet to around 5,200 miles (4,500 nautical miles) from up to 5,400 miles (4,700 nautical miles). The range cut, while seemingly small, could mean the difference between flying from New York to most of Europe versus just Western Europe. “The XLR is absolutely heavier than Airbus wanted it to be originally,” said Jon Ostrower, editor of The Air Current, on a recent episode of The Air Show. “That really affected the heavily loaded long-range operations that airlines like Frontier wanted with 240 seats.” Discounter Frontier Airlines canceled its order for the XLR in August citing performance concerns. “The airplane likely won’t have the range to do some of the routes people have hoped to see, like East Coast to Rome,” said Brett Snyder, president of the travel assistance service Cranky Concierge and author of the Cranky Flier blog. “But it is enabling flying including Dublin to Nashville and Indianapolis. Over time, there will be more opportunity to stretch and try new things.” Most airlines seem unconcerned over the range cut. “It’s only a concern during the peak summers,” says Ramiro Sequeira, the chief operating officer of Iberia, of the A321XLR’s capabilities. The carrier believes it can do everything it hoped to with the plane — if not more. Iberia was the first to fly the XLR, debuting the plane on flights between Madrid and Boston in November. It plans to introduce it in April on flights to Washington, D.C., pending the delayed delivery of its second aircraft from Airbus. Sequeira hasn’t revealed what’s next for the plane at Iberia. “New routes are the secret of the commercial department,” he says. Travelers can expect a product on board the XLR similar to what they would see on a larger plane. American plans to introduce a new business class and premium economy product on its A321XLRs when they debut later this year. The airline will outfit the planes with 20 of its new lie-flat “Flagship Suites” up front, 12 spacious premium economy seats in the middle, and an updated economy product in the back. “We’re really pleased (about) the introduction of our new Flagship Suite,” American CEO Robert Isom told investors on January 23, citing the XLR as among the first planes to receive the seats. He emphasized that passenger comfort was important on planes that will fly longer international routes. Aer Lingus and Iberia outfitted their planes with lie-flat business class seats up front and standard economy seats in back. And customer feedback, they said, is largely positive. “The customer,” Moody said, “for all intents and purposes, doesn’t mind traveling on the narrow-body versus the wide-body.”\n",

      "Headline: ‘World’s clearest lake’ is being threatened by tourists\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/travel/new-zealand-blue-lake-spc-c2e/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Deep within Nelson Lakes National Park, in New Zealand’s South Island, lies a magical blue-violet lake. Surrounded by steep alpine forests and spring-fed from the glacial waters of Lake Constance, it is small but not insignificant. It was first discovered by Ngāti Apa, a Māori iwi, or tribe, who named it Rotomairewhenua, meaning “the lake of peaceful lands.” It became a sacred place where they cleansed the bones of the dead, believing this would secure the spirit a safe journey to the ancestral Māori homeland of Hawaiki. In more recent history, hikers passing through the national park have commented on the lake’s extraordinary color and ethereal energy, but it was only around a decade ago that scientists discovered that the water of the sub-alpine lake had “exceptional optical purity” with a visibility of between 70 and 80 meters. That’s in line with that of pure water, which they said made it “the most visually clear freshwater yet reported.” The title of “clearest lake in the world” and photos of the stunning landscape have since been shared widely on social media, making the lake a popular tourist destination between December and March (during New Zealand’s summer). But conservationists and the Ngāti Apa now fear that this increased popularity could threaten the purity of the lake. Their biggest concern is the spread of lindavia, a microscopic alga known colloquially as “lake snow” or “lake snot” for the slime it creates that hangs just below the surface of the water. The alga is already present downstream of Rotomairewhenua (also known as Blue Lake) in lakes Rotoiti, Rotoroa and Tennyson, and is at risk of being carried up the trail on hikers’ boots or in their water bottles. An invasive species to New Zealand, lindavia most likely made its way there from North America, possibly via fishing gear, speculates Phil Novis, a senior research scientist specializing in algae at the government-owned environmental institute Landcare Research. The first records of it in the country are in the early 2000s and since then it has spread fairly widely. “Humans are the main vector,” he says, explaining that in previous research his team collected and tested sediment cores from 380 lakes in New Zealand, and the only ones with lindavia present were those easily accessible to humans. Just one small speck of it could change the ecology of a lake forever, he adds, and it can be carried fairly easily in water droplets. He recalls one instance when he found a sample of lindavia on the chest hair of a man who had swum a couple of kilometers through Lake Wānaka, in the Otago region of New Zealand. While it is not known to be toxic for humans, the alga excretes long viscous strands known as mucilage that when concentrated can become a nuisance – known to clog up fishing lines, boat filters or hydroelectric power systems. In the case of Rotomairewhenua, the film of slime it creates could obscure the lake’s exceptional clarity. “We are deeply concerned,” says Jen Skilton, ecologist and Taiao advisor (environmental manager) for Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō Trust, a non-profit organization that supports the iwi. “If this invasive microorganism enters the lake, it has the potential to have far-reaching consequences, affecting the water quality and overall health of the lake.” She adds that this would be devastating for the Ngāti Apa, for whom Rotomairewhenua holds immense cultural and spiritual significance. While they no longer use the lake for ancient rituals, it is a part of their identity, she says: “We maintain a living connection to our ancestral traditions and ensure that Rotomairewhenua is preserved for future generations.” Since 2013, when the research on the lake’s clarity was published, visitor numbers have more than doubled, according to New Zealand’s Department of Conservation, which collects voluntary data provided by hikers at the visitors’ hut near Rotomairewhenua. Most people trek to the lake via two or seven-day circuits, or as part of the Te Araroa long distance trail, which spans the entire length of New Zealand. The title of “clearest lake in the world” and the resulting social media buzz has definitely contributed to its popularity, says Melissa Griffin, senior biodiversity ranger for Nelson Lakes at the Department of Conservation. “Before then it was a beautiful place that was known, but not many people went there. Then when it got the title, that really started to increase the amount of trampers (hikers) that were going to the lake.” As a result, the Department of Conservation, Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō Trust and Te Araroa Trust, have been working together to introduce biosecurity measures along the route. They have installed cleaning stations beside the lakes where lindavia is present, with educational signs requesting that hikers clean their shoes and gear before traveling on towards Rotomairewhenua, and potentially taking new species with them. Most of all, through signs and videos broadcast on the Te Araroa trail app, they are urging visitors not to touch the water – be it swimming, wetting a towel to cool down, or dipping in a GoPro to get an underwater shot. This is not only due to the biosecurity risk but also out of respect for the place: “The water of Rotomairewhenua is ‘tapu’ (sacred) and entering the water is a violation of that,” says Skilton. During the summer, a warden – often someone from the Department of Conservation or a Ngāti Apa representative – stays for an extended period at the lake to watch over and talk to hikers, explaining the biosecurity risks, the lake’s cultural significance, and potential human impact. So far, there are signs that people are respecting the guidance, and fewer examples of visitors recklessly dipping themselves or a towel in the water after a long and sweaty hike. But surveys show there is still a gap between understanding the risk and being proactive about averting it. Janet Newell, biodiversity ranger for the Department of Conservation, says that while people acknowledge they have read the signs at cleaning stations and understand why they are there, that doesn’t necessarily translate into them using them. There’s a belief that “it’s not me that’s the problem, it’s other people,” she says. As Rotomairewhenua is part of a national park, restricting visitor numbers would be difficult, and it’s not a measure the Department of Conservation wants to take. Instead, the message it wants to get out is for people to go and enjoy these pristine environments but consider the wider impact that they are having. When working as a hut warden, Griffin’s role included picking up rubbish and cleaning the toilets. “The increase in numbers has meant that the number of times we need to empty those toilets is increasing,” she says. “So then you have costs of helicopters, the carbon of getting a helicopter into the backcountry: these are all things to consider when you think about the number of people that are going into the backcountry.” But at the same time, “You want people to go and enjoy and be able to see it, and sit there and sit with it,” she says, recalling her first visits. “There’s something really special about getting there, standing next to the lake, and it’s just peaceful. You hear lots of birds, but the water is peaceful, and seeing into it is crazy, it’s so stunning.” In the end it comes down to a fine balance, says Skilton: “The growing number of visitors brings both opportunity and responsibility. It is crucial that all who visit understand the significance of this place and take the necessary steps to minimize their impact. “By adhering to the rules and guidelines, we can protect the lake’s unique ecological features and safeguard its cultural importance for future generations.”\n",

      "Headline: Airbus gets on board with double-level airplane seating\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/travel/airbus-exploring-chaise-longue-double-level-airplane-seat-design/index.html\n",
      "Summary: If you’ve seen images of the infamous double-level airplane seat concept and thought “that’s never going to happen” — maybe think again. Aviation start-up Chaise Longue, the brains behind the controversial dual-level seat, announced today it’s “exploring some early stage concepts” with aviation giant Airbus. This collaboration with an aircraft manufacturing heavyweight is a significant step in this seat design’s journey from college student project to potential in-air reality. Designer and Chaise Longue CEO Alejandro Núñez Vicente tells CNN Travel he’s thankful Airbus sees “the true potential of two-level seating.” An Airbus representative confirmed to CNN Travel that “Chaise Longue is exploring some early stage concepts with Airbus on two-level seating solutions for Airbus commercial aircraft.” The representative added that “given the nature of this early phase level,” Airbus preferred “not to further comment at this stage.” The crux of Núñez Vicente’s Chaise Longue seat design is the removal of the overhead cabin to allow two levels of seats in a single aircraft cabin. The idea is that travelers would have the option of booking the top row or the bottom row — and while the lower level might look less-than-appealing in photos, bottom passengers would be able to stretch out their legs and enjoy extra leg room. The top level is also designed to give “larger recline angles” and “leg-stretching possibility” than your average economy airplane seat, says Núñez Vicente. Núñez Vicente initially developed the design for economy cabins before last year premiering a business class/first class iteration. CNN Travel tested out early prototypes of both concepts and concluded that while the lower level has definite claustrophobia potential, the increased leg room could cancel out the potential cabin fever for some passengers. Núñez Vicente says he can’t specify what kind of cabin the Airbus collaborations might target — and he can’t currently confirm how similar or different the new concepts might be to the previously showcased concepts. There are currently no concept images available or details on the new designs. But Núñez Vicente says the Chaise Longue goal remains the same: to “optimize the space” in the cabin for passengers and airlines alike. Núñez Vicente’s design has gone viral on more than one occasion — with some prospective travelers cracking jokes about passing wind, while others suggest the design is a cynical ploy to cram more passengers into the cabin. Núñez Vicente emphasizes he’s not trying to eradicate regular airplane seating altogether. He envisages an airplane cabin in which the Chaise Longue is in the center, flanked by two rows of traditional airplane seating. The fact that this concept could also “give the airline a new revenue stream or a new way to make more money out of those passengers or put more seats in” — as Núñez Vicente put it at the Aviation Interiors Expo in 2024 — is merely an added bonus, he insists. And in general, Núñez Vicente is a believer in the old adage that there’s no such thing as bad publicity. Continued interest in the design from the aviation industry suggests airlines and aircraft manufacturers are unperturbed by the seat’s social media backlash. “Every innovation has a lot of good reviews and also bad reviews,” says Núñez Vicente, suggesting the naysayers haven’t impacted the development of the design. “Of course, there are drawbacks, and the social media one is there,” says Núñez Vicente. “It’s a present one. But to be honest, the advantages of this, these seats on two levels, are completely on top of those drawbacks.” Núñez Vicente says Chaise Longue also remains “open for collaboration” with other aviation companies. In the meantime, it’s unlikely you’ll see double-level seating on an airplane near you anytime soon — as Núñez Vicente acknowledges, “there is still a long development ahead.” “However, with the support from Airbus this is a realistic and achievable objective that will greatly improve travel for passengers,” he says.\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/style/bridget-jones-clothes-50s-frazzled-englishwoman/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Twenty-four years since actor Renée Zellweger first appeared in the film adaptation of Helen Fielding’s literary bestseller “Bridget Jones’s Diary,” she’s back for her fourth turn as an endearing, klutzy character looking for love. Although this time, in “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy,” she’s no longer a carefree young woman, but a widow in her 50s, with two kids. Jones’s personal style — a quirky, at times ill-fitting wardrobe of short skirts, cleavage-revealing tops, mumsy cardigans, granny pants and long scarves — helped cement her character into an unforgettable part of noughties pop culture history. Though, this wasn’t the intention of costume designer Rachael Fleming. When creating the outfits for the first 2001 Bridget Jones cast, Fleming sought to give Jones — whose diary entries detailed her romantic adventures, weight, and alcohol and cigarette consumption — a pragmatic, somewhat disheveled look that would feel relatable to busy women. It’s a perspective that feels even more pertinent now in a glossy world of seemingly perfect and photoshopped images. The style has since spawned a microtrend coined as the “Frazzled Englishwoman” aesthetic, which encompasses the kind of haphazard layering often seen on British people because of the country’s unpredictable weather. Think of a jilted Kate Winslet in “The Holiday” or a befuddled Keira Knightley in “Love Actually.” Such archetypes have also inadvertently appeared on the runways of luxury brands such as Chanel and Miu Miu. Maintaining a feeling of “authenticity” and being “rooted in reality” was crucial to Molly Emma Rowe, the costume designer for Bridget Jones’s latest big screen adaptation. “Bridget has some nice clothes, and she tries her best, but she sort-of always gets it a bit wrong. There’s always something a little bit off, whether it’s the fit, or the pattern or color clashing,” she told CNN over a phone call. In the new film, which releases in UK cinemas and on Peacock in the US on February 13, Rowe said there are fewer “iconic clothing moments” — such as the Playboy bunny outfit that Jones wore to the Tarts and Vicars party where almost nobody else is in costume, or the racy tiger-print underwear styled with nothing but a camisole and cardigan as she chased Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) in the snow. This time round, those kinds of “uncomfortable situations” simply don’t feature, added Rowe. With Jones now juggling a career with parenting, friendships and dating, “it’s a very emotional film,” Rowe explained. “We’re trying to bring Bridget back to life and help her navigate through her grief. It was important for us that as she was finding her way, her clothes didn’t sort of challenge that.” Jones’s wardrobe, like the character, is palpably more grown up. Cocktail dresses and cozy twinsets have been swapped out for work-appropriate blazers and cardigans layered over shirts, though Rowe retained some of Jones’s flirty personality by dressing her in pieces such as a mini skirt, made more demure styled with stockings. There are also plenty of subtle, nostalgic references to previous films, such as an emerald green dress, which Jones, in the opening scene of the new movie, struggles to zip up without Darcy — a nod to her look in the third film when she reunites with Darcy. With only 12 weeks to pull together a wardrobe for the cast, and few of Jones’s old clothing in the archives, Rowe recreated some historical looks— such as the infamous red penguin-print pajama set (a version of the pajama top is worn by Jones on a school run in the new film). “The original ones no longer exist, so we had to recreate them,” explained Rowe. “We color-tested loads of reds on screen to make sure that after filming it would still look like the original red. That required fading out (the fabric), pulling threads and breaking buttons, to make them look like they’d been worn and washed over 20 years.” That was a key premise of the clothes worn by Jones: “Fashion is cyclical. You might find things that you’ve worn many years ago that you try out again later. We saw Bridget doing that,” noted Rowe. Many of the pieces Zellweger wore in the film were thrifted from charity and consignment stores, such as Mary’s Living and Giving in Hampstead, the north London neighborhood where her character lives. “Mark died four years ago and Bridget’s not out buying clothes. She’s struggling to keep it together, which is one of the reasons why nothing (in her life) looks new,” Rowe said. Coping with grief and its subsequent impact on how one dresses was another focal point. Rowe drew on her personal experience having lost her father as a teenager, a “confusing time” that changed how her mother dressed. “My mom wore a lot of his clothes during that period. I think it was like reaching for a comfort blanket.” That inspired the oversized bobbly gray cardigan and shirts, monogrammed with Mark Darcy’s initials, which Jones is seen wearing throughout. For Rowe, it also added a nuanced perspective that wasn’t part of the script: “We could create the idea of what Mark Darcy might have been wearing at home with Bridget and the kids, which is not something you ever see on screen.” “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy” also follows the recent releases of films that center on women in their 50s, such as “The Substance,” the provocative horror-comedy starring Demi Moore as a former A-lister past her prime and drawn to the potential benefits of a mysterious new drug, and “Babygirl,” an erotic thriller featuring Nicole Kidman as a high-flying CEO who begins an illicit affair with a young intern. It’s a welcome development after years of inequality in the representation of middle-aged and older females in film and television (female characters aged 50 and above continue to have a limited presence on screen and are far less likely to have a romantic storyline, according to a 2024 report by the Geena Davis Institute in collaboration with the NextFifty Initiative.) If Rowe has a message for viewers, it’s that she hopes they’ll be “empowered to feel comfortable in their vulnerabilities,” she said. “To be a woman approaching or in her 50s and having these kinds of films to watch is very inspiring.”\n",

      "Summary: What is the state of American fashion right now? It’s a question at least partly answered by New York Fashion Week, which concluded Tuesday, where brands including Thom Browne and Calvin Klein showed their latest collections in a season marked by major debuts, returns and decisive shake-ups for American designers. Amid a wider industry reshuffling, several major labels and cult mainstays — including Proenza Schouler, Area and Helmut Lang — were absent from the schedule following the departure of their creative directors. Some heritage brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren skipped the season entirely, while others showed overseas or across state lines. (Willy Chavarria, one of New York’s most prominent designers, opted to show during Paris’ menswear week; Bode, though still officially on the schedule, debuted its collection in New Orleans as part of the football- and fashion-centric GQ Bowl.) A pared-down week in New York nonetheless saw doses of theatricality, including Marc Jacobs’ off-schedule procession of doll-like models in exaggerated silhouettes, Christian Siriano’s automotive-inspired gowns and flashy clubwear, and Thom Browne’s conceptual closing that saw besuited models as otherworldly birds. But understated collections focused on wearability were par for the course, from Eckhaus Latta’s “anti-snobbish” showing of leather bombers, cargo pants and casual asymmetrical dresses to Veronica Leoni’s highly anticipated debut collection for Calvin Klein. In the latter brand’s first runway show since creative director Raf Simons’ departure in 2018, Leoni seemed to issue a return-to-work order, with sleek business casual attire made weightless through wide tailoring and billowing silk. “I really tried to explore beauty in the most authentic, clean, fresh and pure way,” she told reporters, including CNN, backstage. “We (were) inspired by the archive, but didn’t get into any nostalgia. We tried not to get stuck looking too much into the past.” Klein, now 82, was in attendance at his namesake label’s comeback. So too were Calvin Klein models past and present, including Kate Moss, Christy Turlington, FKA Twigs and Kendall Jenner, the last of whom walked the show in an ankle-length pinstripe coat dress. Elsewhere, Ella Emhoff, Dove Cameron, actor Cole Sprouse and Japanese Breakfast singer Michelle Zauner showed up for Collina Strada, while Katie Holmes, Whoopi Goldberg and Julianne Hough sat front row at Christian Siriano. Actress and singer Keke Palmer made appearances at both Brandon Maxwell and Sergio Hudson. Following a quieter midpoint for celebrity appearances, Tory Burch and Thom Browne both drew a number of A-Listers to close out the week. At the Museum of Modern Art, Amanda Seyfried, Martha Stewart, Ciara and Jodie-Turner Smith were among the front-row guests for Burch’s spin on classic sportswear, while at The Shed arts center, Cara Delevingne, Kerry Washington, Queen Latifah and Adrien Brody showed up in variations of Browne’s “uniform” — the suit. Backstage, shortly before presenting his new codes of “opulent American sportswear,” Hudson spoke to the challenges facing American designers. “I don’t think there’s a lack of talent. I think it’s a lack of support,” he said, pointing to a shift in focus towards European fashion weeks. “There’s a lot of great designers here, and I just feel like they’re being ignored. We have to open up our eyes and see what we have at home.” At Christopher John Rogers’ long-awaited return to the New York schedule after a five-year hiatus — a vibrant showing of color-blocked, striped halter dresses and tasseled button-downs and pants  — the designer alluded to the difficulties in maintaining an independent label. “We haven’t been immune to the recent challenges of the industry and are grateful as a brand to be here now presenting this body of work,” he said in the show notes. Ahead of Elena Velez’s runway, where mermaid and siren archetypes served as muses in netting, leather and wet, ruffled gowns, the Wisconsin-born designer called fashion “a longevity game.” “It’s one of those industries where you have to claw your way into people’s realities, and you have to impose yourself in this space to be taken seriously,” she told CNN over a phone call. In past seasons, Velez has done so through dramatic presentations — including a literal mud pit fight club — and atypical partnerships, including one with OnlyFans. In keeping with this season’s lost-at-sea mood, she said, fittingly: “There’s no plan b — I’ll sink with my ship.” Politics cast a shadow across the week’s proceedings. Less than a month into a turbulent new political administration, major fashion brands have been caught in the crosshairs of the budding US-China trade war; it is also unclear how new anti-DEI policies will impact an industry that has often struggled to be equitable and inclusive, both on the runway and behind the scenes. Designers used the opportunity to call for community in the face of the unknown. “On the runway, we celebrate beauty and age and gender and body,” Siriano told CNN backstage. “We need fantasy. We need dreams. We need to show all of the colors and cultures that are here, especially in New York.” Prabal Gurung, whose previous collection celebrated the hope of a different political future, looked to forms of intimacy in his latest presentation. “I think, you know, we are all in the same space, confused, uncertain, anxious,” he told CNN backstage. “But one thing that I refuse to give in (to) is being reactive and giving into cynicism… So I always feel like in confusing, dystopian times, what we’re looking for is connection.” At Collina Strada, where founder and creative director Hillary Taymour celebrated a matriarchal vision of the “fempire,” two models in upcycled heirloom bridal dresses kissed on the runway, while others wore bug-eyed protective shades — “to hide our tears,” Taymour noted backstage. “Community is everything. Love your neighbors, love everyone. Trans rights, protect women, protect everyone. It’s going to be a really hard time in society, and let’s take care of each other.” Scroll to see this season’s highlights.\n",

      "Headline: Thousands call on Christie’s to cancel AI art auction in open letter\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/style/christies-ai-auction-open-letter-tan/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Nearly 4,000 people have signed an open letter calling on Christie’s New York to cancel an upcoming sale dedicated solely to art created with artificial intelligence (AI) — the first of its kind for a major auction house — over concerns that the programs used to create some generative digital pieces are trained on copyrighted work and exploit human artists. The online letter began circulating Saturday, the day after the Christie’s Augmented Intelligence sale was announced. The sale, which the auction house expects will bring in more than $600,000, includes work by artists Refik Anadol, Harold Cohen, Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, Alexander Reben and Claire Silver. The more than 20 lots in the sale span five decades, and roughly one quarter are digitally native works like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), according to Christie’s. Examples of other works in the auction include light boxes and screens, as well as sculptures, paintings and prints. Bidding is scheduled to begin February 20 and run until March 5. At publishing, the letter calling on Christie’s to halt the auction had 3,936 signatures attached. The authors largely take issue with the AI models used to create some of the works in the sale, which they say were trained on copyrighted works without their creators’ authorization. “These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them,” the letter reads. “Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies’ mass theft of human artists’ work.” The use of artists’ copyrighted work to train generative AI models that power programs like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and Dall-E have resulted in lawsuits against the technology companies creating the software. Artists say their work has been used by the AI programs to train models without their permission or financial compensation. The technology companies defend themselves by citing fair use, which allows for the use of some copyrighted material without permission in some cases. “Why are Christie’s condoning these models by helping sell these works for tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, when the models are directly leading to the impoverishment of so many artists that they’ve stolen from?” Ed Newton-Rex, the chief executive of Fairly Trained, a non-profit that certifies generative AI companies for fairer data sourcing, wrote on X. The letter is addressed to Christie’s digital art specialists Nicole Sales Giles and Sebastian Sanchez, who are heading up the auction. In a statement, a spokesperson for the auction house told The Art Newspaper: “The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognized in leading museum collections. The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work.” Sarp Kerem Yavuz, an artist whose practice sometimes incorporates AI and whose work is included in the Christie’s sale (and a contributor to The Art Newspaper), says the idea that AI-generated art is theft is based on a misunderstanding of the data sets used in such work. “Most AI-generated images result from the combination of millions — literally millions — of images, which means no single artist can claim that an image of a meadow, a heroic knight, a cat or a flower was based on their specific creation,” he wrote in a statement. “AI-generated images mimic human inspiration in many ways — they’re just more efficient at parsing through information.” As AI technology advances and becomes more integrated into day-to-day life, laws regarding copyright and fair use are struggling to keep up. Last month, the US Copyright Office ruled that artists can copyright work they created using AI tools, but that “purely AI-generated material” remains ineligible for protections.

      "Headline: How much coffee is too much, according to a doctor\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/health/caffeine-longevity-heart-wellness/index.html\n",
      "Summary: With millions sipping their morning coffee to start the day, recent research has generated new buzz about caffeine consumption. A large UK study from September found that moderate caffeine consumption from coffee or tea reduced the risk of developing multiple cardiometabolic diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Another study, published in January, concluded that drinking coffee in the morning was especially beneficial in reducing cardiovascular disease and premature death. That’s nice to know, but what is the evidence for coffee’s health benefits? And what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits? How much coffee is good for most people, according to these studies — and how much is too much? Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption? And if you don’t like coffee, are there similar benefits from drinking tea or other beverages? To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN: What’s the evidence for coffee’s health benefits, and what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits? Dr. Leana Wen: The evidence is quite strong. In addition to the recent studies, a plethora of research over decades has found that moderate consumption of coffee is associated with lowering the risk of developing multiple diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers and even dementia. Exactly why this is the case is not known, though there are several hypotheses. For instance, coffee contains chemicals that are thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, perhaps contributing to its effect on reducing cancer risk. Substances contained in coffee could help the body better use insulin and assist with blood sugar control. And some ingredients could help better process cholesterol, possibly contributing to protecting against negative outcomes. More research is needed to understand what components of coffee have beneficial health effects. CNN: How much coffee is good for you? Wen: Many of these studies found positive health effects at a moderate level of consumption, which is generally defined as between two and four cups of coffee per day. In the 2024 UK study, the risk of developing multiple new cardiometabolic diseases was reduced by over 48% for those who had three cups of coffee per day compared with those who didn’t drink or who drank less than one cup a day. According to a large 2022 study, the biggest decline in early mortality was seen for those who drank two to three cups of coffee a day. Interestingly, this study found that ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of early death the most (27%). Instant coffee had less of an effect (11%). CNN: How much coffee is too much? Wen: The concern with too much coffee is about consuming too much caffeine, which can cause heart palpitations, anxiety, restlessness and difficulty sleeping. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is safe for most adults. That is approximately the amount in four 8-ounce cups of brewed coffee. Many people exceed this amount and experience no ill effects. But people who have sleep difficulties or other problems should be aware that these could be due to caffeine consumption. CNN: What about caffeine from espresso, teas and sodas? Wen: One 1-ounce shot of espresso contains around 60 to 70 milligrams of caffeine. A cup of black tea typically has 40 to 50 milligrams of caffeine but can have as much as 90 milligrams. Green teas and white teas will have less caffeine. Sodas also vary in caffeine content, but typically a 12-ounce serving will have 3 milligrams to 70 milligrams of caffeine. Other drinks I want to be sure to flag are energy drinks. These drinks can contain large amounts of caffeine, often packing 200 or even 300 milligrams in one serving. People should be aware of the total amount of caffeine and other ingredients they are consuming through the day for all these different beverages. Sodas and energy drinks can contain a lot of added sugars, for instance, along with other chemicals that are not good for your health. CNN: Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption? Wen: Yes. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 12 do not consume caffeine. Children ages 12 to 18 should not exceed 100 milligrams of caffeine per day. Pregnant women should also be cautious about caffeine intake. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, less than 200 milligrams a day is not associated with miscarriage or preterm birth; it recommends limiting intake to under this amount during pregnancy. Small amounts of caffeine can pass from the breastfeeding mother to infant, but less than 300 milligrams a day should be safe for breastfeeding women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other people who should use caution include those with underlying heart conditions and those who use medications that could make someone more sensitive to the effects of caffeine, such as certain thyroid and antidepressant medications. In addition, people who have trouble sleeping should consider limiting their caffeine intake to the morning hours. Those who have questions about their specific medical circumstances should consult a health care provider. CNN: What about those who don’t drink coffee? Can they get similar benefits from tea or other caffeinated beverages? Wen: This is an interesting question. It’s not known at this time whether the health benefit from coffee is from the caffeine in the coffee, which could be replicated through non-coffee drinks, or whether they are intrinsic to what’s in the coffee itself. There may be benefits to drinking tea, whether it contains a large amount of caffeine or not. Some studies have found that drinking tea is also associated with lower mortality and lower risk of some diseases. This benefit does not apply to other caffeine-containing drinks like energy drinks and sodas; whatever benefit the caffeine in these drinks could have would likely be negated by the negative health impacts of added sugars and other chemicals. In short, my takeaway from these studies about coffee isn’t that everyone needs to drink it. Adults who do probably have some health benefit if they drink it in moderation. Everyone needs to be aware of the total caffeine intake they have, and there are people — notably young children — who really should not be consuming caffeine.\n",

      "Headline: In need of a dopamine hit? 5 things to know about creating a dopamine menu\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/health/dopamenu-adhd-reward-dopamine-wellness/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes here. (CNN) — If you are like many people, you might feel zapped of energy and in need of some motivation to get going, especially in the Northern Hemisphere where the days now are short, overcast and sometimes packed with snow. But even finding that inspiration can feel like a chore. Enter the dopamine menu, or what we call a “dopamenu.” This personalized menu of activities is designed to deliver a hit of dopamine to your system. Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter involved in our brain’s reward system. It plays a central role in motivation, as well as executive function (which includes attention, decision-making, multitasking and planning), movement and emotional regulation. The dopamenu is “kind of a creative project meets … a list of strategies to use,” Eric Tivers, a licensed clinical social worker, recently told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his podcast Chasing Life. “In some ways, it’s like a portion of a self-care plan.” Tivers, who co-coined the term dopamenu, is an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, coach and host of the podcast “ADHD reWired.” ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters — including dopamine — leading to issues such as inattention, impulsivity and poor executive function. ADHD can have wide-ranging impacts on all aspects of life, including academics, personal relationships, professional success and even daily functioning. Tivers, who counsels people with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder, knows of what he speaks — he also has a diagnosis of ADHD. Speaking about people with ADHD, Tivers explained, “Part of what happens … is our brain does not inhibit stimuli very well, and a lot of that stimuli can be internal. Like random thoughts seem to come at the most inopportune time. And because we have a hard time prioritizing, our brain doesn’t turn down its focus on … other stimuli, whether it’s internal or external.” You can listen to the full episode here. These kinds of brain processing differences between people with and without ADHD also extend to motivation, he said. “Often when people think about motivation, they think about it in the realm of a character trait,” he said. “And motivation is dopamine, right? It is neurological. “People with ADHD have an interest-based nervous system where most people have an importance-based nervous system — the thing is important, so prioritize that and get that thing done. For people with ADHD and other neurodivergent people, because we have this interest-based nervous system, it is super hard to actually do the boring thing.” To help break through the boredom and initiate an action, Tivers developed the idea of a dopamine menu, a custom menu of small, satisfying activities designed to boost focus, motivation and well-being that people can turn to, in the moment, to find relief. A dopamenu is useful not only for people with ADHD, Tivers added, but also a host of other conditions, such as depression or seasonal affective disorder (SAD), in which low dopamine is a factor. It is even helpful if you are a normie, or neurotypical. “The people with ADHD, we need to use these strategies, but these are often really great strategies for everybody,” Tivers said. What do you need to know about creating and using your own dopamenu? Tivers has these five tips. It’s the same principle behind making a list before you go to the grocery store and not going when you are hungry, Tivers said. “When we are bored, when we are understimulated, when we are feeling kind of down, that’s not the time we want to be thinking of, ‘What can I do to sort of lift my spirits or my mood?’” he said. People can prepare in advance to have ideas “we can kind of just fall back on, so we’re not having to come up with those ideas in the moment when we really need (them).” If unprepared, many of us will default to grabbing our phones when we aren’t stimulated, Tivers said, which is like grabbing a candy bar instead of a solid meal when we are hungry. “You’re probably going to actually feel worse than you did beforehand,” he added. Pro tip: Put the list where you can easily see it, like on the fridge or on the bathroom mirror. Your dopamenu is unique to your interests and your lifestyle. Consider items such as mindful movement (like a walk around the block, a one-song dance party, a bike ride), creative outlets, social connections, novel experiences and rest & recovery (a short nap or soothing bath, for example). If you are coming up short on ideas, Tivers recommends a quick Google search for dopamenu to spark your creativity. “I think the thing that surprised me the most is how many people across the Internet have created their menus and posted them online,” he said. While you can organize your dopamenu any way you’d like, the idea is to lay it out like a restaurant menu. Think in terms of: • appetizers — a quick bite “that won’t suck you in or make it hard to stop” • main dishes — “things that might either take longer, require scheduling or something you can engage in for a longer period” • specials — “something that is not always accessible” (like going to a concert or on a trip) • and, in small amounts, desserts — “anything that’s sort of recreationally intoxicating, whether it’s alcohol or scrolling … or watching two episodes of a show on Netflix.” But, he warns, just like you might order a slice of cake as a dessert after dinner, you don’t want to eat the entire cake. Some people even add a cost to each item, Tivers noted, based on real costs or opportunity costs; some also rate items (the five-star or five-chili system) based on how big a hit of dopamine it will deliver. Costs and ratings are completely customizable, based on what is important to you. Additional refinements include making different dopamenus based on location (work vs. home) or seasonality (winter vs. summer activities). And remember: A dopamenu is a living document that can and maybe should get updated constantly as you and your life change. When you choose to turn to your dopamenu will depend on … you! “I would say that (when you turn to it) is very based on the individual,” said Tivers, who noted he likes to access his dopamenu first thing in the morning with a workout, because it sets him well for the day. “But you’ve got to experiment,” he said, noting some people want a big dopamine hit in the morning, others will want a nice nightly hit before bed to wind down. “Or you sprinkle it throughout the day because, maybe after an hour or two of work, your brain’s kind of finding everything else to do other than the things you actually need to be doing, right? So then maybe you need more … regular inputs,” he said. You can turn to your dopamenu as often as needed but be aware of behavior patterns. “I know for me, my seasonal affective disorder … around February, March, definitely affects me. So, I have on my calendar, actually starting in late fall, to start increasing my exercise intensity to help counterbalance the cycles of just living in the Chicago area, where you don’t get a lot of sunlight in the wintertime,” he said. Can you overdo it? “What’s that expression? Everything in moderation, including moderation,” Tivers said. “Because if you’re sitting all day trying to regulate, and that’s consuming (you) every day, I would say it’s probably a really good time to start talking to a therapist or psychiatrist if you’re really needing that much support for regulation. The first dopamenu you make might not be perfect (or it might not be for you at all), but that’s OK because creating one is a learning experience. “I think anything that we do with the goal of making life better is an experiment,” Tivers said. “It’s just embracing the idea of living life in beta mode — just experiment and see what happens.” He said the worst that could happen is you might waste some time making “a super duper, nice looking dopamenu” that you never look at again. “But I think that any problem you’re trying to solve, if it doesn’t — quote unquote — work that first try, doesn’t mean it doesn’t work,” he said. “Tweak it, try different things, experiment with it, approach from different angles.” Ultimately, the dopamenu is a tool to serve you. We hope these five tips help you build your own dopamenu. Listen to the full episode here. And join us next week on the Chasing Life podcast when we talk about the green-eyed monster — just in time for Valentine’s Day.\n",

      "Headline: 3 health conditions increase risk of liver damage if you drink, study says\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/09/health/belly-fat-liver-alcohol-wellness/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Drinking alcohol if you have a large belly or diabetes more than doubles the risk of serious liver damage, while having high blood pressure and drinking nearly doubles the risk, a new study found. Those are important health risks to consider, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado, who was not involved in the study. “People are going to do exactly what they shouldn’t do, and poison themselves,” Freeman said. “Particularly during big (sports events), people will eat things like hot dogs, sausage, bacon, pepperoni and ham — and these processed meats are in the same category as cigarettes for cancer risk. “When you’re eating all these highly processed, high fat, high sugar foods, insulin goes into overdrive, which creates insulin resistance, then excess blood sugar, and then fatty liver,” Freeman added. “Then if you’re drinking on top of it, it just amplifies the risk.” A waist measurement of 35 inches or more for women and 40 inches or more for men, which is often associated with obesity, is one of several cardiometabolic risk factors that also include high blood sugar and elevated blood pressure. Nearly half of all Americans have high blood pressure, more than 1 in 3 have pre-diabetes, while about 40% of the population is considered obese, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These health conditions contribute to a buildup of fat in the liver, experts say, which can then lead to fibrosis, or scarring of the liver. “Most people don’t realize this, but before one develops diabetes, for example, they typically first develop fatty liver,” Freeman said. “It has to do with sugar dysregulation — when you have high blood sugars, your liver is storing fat to get rid of some of that sugar, and it’s that excess fat that impairs liver function.” Separately, drinking damages liver cells trying to metabolize alcohol and can lead to additional fat buildup. The inflammation and scarring caused by excess fat may eventually lead to cirrhosis, which increases the risk of liver failure and liver cancer. This double whammy of fatty deposits may be a reason behind the significant increase in liver scarring the study found among moderate to heavy drinkers with chronic conditions, said lead study author Dr. Brian Lee, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine. “The results identify a very high-risk segment of the population prone to liver disease and suggest that preexisting health issues may have a large impact on how alcohol affects the liver,” Lee said in a statement. Just because a person may not have a big belly, high blood pressure or diabetes does not mean that it’s safe for people to heavily consume alcohol, Lee said. “We know that alcohol is toxic to the liver and all heavy drinkers are at risk for advanced liver disease,” Lee said. The study, published recently in the journal of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national government survey of nearly 41,000 people. Of those, over 2,200 were categorized as “heavy” drinkers. In the study, women who drank more than 0.7 ounces (20 grams) or more a day and men who drank 1.05 ounces (30 grams) or more a day were defined as heavy drinkers. .However, that amount of alcohol is typically considered to be “moderate” drinking, according to the CDC. A standard drink in the United States is defined as 0.6 ounces (14 grams) of pure liquor. That’s equivalent to 5 ounces of wine with 12% alcohol, a 12-ounce can of beer that is 5% alcohol or 1.5 ounces (one shot) of liquor (80 proof) or distilled spirts. Most people don’t realize they are pouring drinks that far exceed those standards, experts say. “If you look at what people drink with dinner or as a cocktail, they’re filling up their glass with three or four ounces,” Freeman said. “If a restaurant came out and poured you five ounces of wine, you’d complain that they didn’t fill your glass. People are probably drinking much more than they realize.” An alarming number of new studies are finding that any amount of alcohol is dangerous to health. In January, then-US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued a strongly worded advisory about the link between alcohol and cancer. “Alcohol is a well-established, preventable cause of cancer responsible for about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 cancer deaths annually in the United States – greater than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash fatalities per year in the US – yet the majority of Americans are unaware of this risk,” Murthy said. However, only 45% of Americans surveyed by the American Institute for Cancer Research in 2019 said they believed that drinking alcohol causes cancer, the new advisory notes. One easy way is to substitute mocktails for alcohol, especially in a social setting where you want to feel part of the party. Some mocktails rely on manufactured non-alcoholic spirits, botanicals and bitters but others are simple mixtures of fruit juice, soda, and syrup, experts say. If you find mocktails don’t satisfy your urges for alcohol, experts suggest using the SMART method to set attainable goals. The acronym stands for: 1.        Specific: Set an achievable goal, such as cutting back on drinking three days a week. You can add days until you reach your final goal. 2.        Measurable: How many drinks will you cut — and are you watching the size of your drink? 3.        Achievable: Reduce the number of social engagements where alcohol is likely to be served during your move toward becoming alcohol free. 4. Relevant: Ask yourself how not drinking will help you with with life and health. 5. Time based: Set a reasonable time frame to reduce alcohol consumption. “If you set a bar too high, you may fail, so it’s better to set smaller goals to achieve it,” Dr. Sanam Hafeez, a neuropsychologist based in New York City, told CNN in a prior interview. To start, Hafeez noted, it’s good to be aware of what you’re already doing: “Nothing starts without an honest conversation with yourself.”\n",

      "Headline: German chancellor hits back at Vance comments\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/europe/germans-democracy-scholz-vance-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has rejected “outside” interference in the country’s elections, insisting that Germans would decide their democracy for themselves, as he hit back at comments made by US Vice President JD Vance the day before. Vance delivered a scathing speech at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, in which he turned on European allies and accused them of suppressing free speech, losing control of immigration and refusing to work with hard-right parties in government. The audience had been expecting to hear about the Trump administration’s plans to end the war in Ukraine, but instead faced a lecture from Vance, who told European leaders that the biggest threat to their security was “from within.” Following his speech, Vance met with Alternative for Germany (AfD) co-leader Alice Weidel at the sidelines of the conference, according to a spokesperson for Weidel. They met in a hotel room for about 30 minutes and spoke about the Ukraine war and German politics, the spokesperson said. The hard-right, anti-immigration party is surging in polls ahead of elections next week. Standing on the same stage as Vance Saturday, Scholz rejected the vice president’s  comments and insisted that Germany would not accept foreign interference in its domestic politics. “A commitment to ‘never again’ cannot be reconciled with support for the AfD,” Scholz told audiences in the Bavarian capital. “We will not accept outsiders intervening in our democracy, in our elections, in the democratic formation of opinion in favour of this party,” he continued, adding that that should especially not happen “among friends and allies.” Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party, as well as Germany’s other mainstream parties, have ruled out working with the AfD, in a stance which has become known as a “firewall.” Also during his speech, Scholz predicted that the future Berlin government would ease the country’s so-called debt brake, in order to spend more on defense and security. Germany’s debt brake is a constitutional article that prevents the government from borrowing excessively and amassing debt. Germany’s government last month said it had met NATO’s target to spend 2% of its GDP on defense– this however falls significantly short of the Trump administration’s fresh demand of 5%.\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/world/vances-speech-upsets-european-leaders-intl-latam/index.html\n",
      "Summary: It felt like a speech, if delivered on X.com, laden surely with community notes. US Vice President JD Vance, taking the stage in Munich, to eviscerate totalitarianism in Europe. But not in Moscow, especially after its savage invasion of Ukraine. Instead, in Ukraine’s allies in the European Union. The “enemy within”, as he called it, in Europe, is jailing opponents, and afraid of its own voters. For the vast majority of the audience, both in Munich – and the rest of Europe – this is the tweet where the reader comments take a conspiratorial, Red-Bull-mother’s-basement-barefoot-at-3-a.m. turn, and you tune out. But while Munich had been hoping to hear greater detail on the Trump administration’s publicly morphing peace plan for Ukraine, they were battered with a bizarre, post-truth litany of culture-war complaints and a bid to sow serious doubt about electoral integrity across Europe. First up was the suggestion Romania’s recently annulled presidential vote was somehow a bid to deny voters their choice. To be clear, Romania annulled only the first round of a presidential vote last year in which a far-right, pro-Russian candidate very narrowly won a place in a second-round run-off, because courts agreed with evidence from Romania’s intelligence agencies that there had been significant interference from Russia. Vance was objecting to the rule of law in Romania, and pro-Russian sentiment and electoral interference being tackled. It is really not clear who he was referring to when he said his European allies were censoring their opponents, or “putting them in jail – whether that’s the leader of the opposition, or a humble Christian praying in her own home, or a journalist trying to report the news.” It sounded like eastern Germany in the 1950s – a world geographically just a few hundred kilometers to the north, where these Soviet-era horrors are still living memories. Vance said “old entrenched interests” were “hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation.” To be clear, many in the room would have hailed from the brutal occupation of the former Soviet Union. They didn’t need to be lectured on how authoritarianism spouts falsehood to excuse the poor and cruel governance of the minority. Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, quickly replied Vance’s words were “unacceptable.” He opposed “the impression that Vice President Vance has created that minorities are being suppressed or silenced in our democracy. We know not only against whom we are defending our country, but also for what.” Vance then launched into a wide-ranging diatribe about freedom of speech being shackled in Europe. He cited a case of a man arrested for praying silently near an abortion clinic in the UK. New laws in Britain mean political activity is prohibited within 150 meters of abortion clinics to prevent women being harassed when seeking medical help – not quite the same thing. Abortion is less of a hot-button issue in Europe than in the United States, and happens with much less controversy. Vance’s complaints struck at the heart of a key difference in the role of free speech in Europe and the United States, a much fresher democracy. In Europe, free speech is paramount and enshrined in law, but so is responsibility for the safety of citizens. Some European legal systems suggest this means you cannot falsely shout there is a “fire” in a crowded theater and escape punishment if the resulting stampede causes injury simply because you had the right to shout “fire.” In the United States, the First Amendment means you can shout whatever you want. In the smartphone and post-9/11 era, Europe has prohibited some extremist activity online. It is still illegal to advocate for the Nazis in Germany, and it should not be controversial or mysterious why. The wildly rebellious press across Europe are a vibrant sign of its free speech. And the fringe parties Vance objected to being absent in Munich are growing in their popularity. Nobody is really being shut down. Vance had clearly long prepared this tirade as a starting gun for the second Trump administration’s bid to refuel populism across Europe. The continent he spoke to is a little wiser now, after Trump’s first term with some populist experiments already ending in electoral disaster – like in the United Kingdom, where the Conservative Party has been ejected from power. Vance spoke to a room acutely aware of the threat far-right populism poses to mainstream and moderate ideology, and the challenges of immigration that have swept across Europe that Vance railed against with barely veiled xenophobia. But the real figure looming large across the room he feverishly addressed was Kremlin head Vladimir Putin. The sins the audience and Europe were accused of are, in reality, occurring in Russia. Putin was not mentioned. Ukraine was only mentioned fleetingly. The bad guys were the United States’ own allies. And the real threat to Western democracy was itself. It should not take an extensive grasp of history to know it is ugly to talk this way in Munich. Europe has been here before. As George Orwell said as the dust of the last big land war settled in 1949, the “final most essential command” of the Party was to “reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.” Vance asked for that, and made it sound like a virtue.\n",

      "Headline: Florida and Tennessee legislatures pass sweeping immigration packages, mirroring Trump’s agenda\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/politics/gop-led-states-trump-policy-agenda/index.html\n",
      "Summary: In his nearly four weeks in office, President Donald Trump has unveiled a constant stream of policy priorities in quick succession, from shrinking government, to cutting taxes, to waging a war on diversity initiatives, illegal immigration and transgender rights. His allies in the states are rushing to keep up. The Florida and Tennessee legislatures have passed sweeping immigration packages that will make it easier for state law enforcement and federal immigration officials to coordinate during recent special sessions. Leaders in Ohio and Arkansas are renewing efforts to place work requirements on Medicaid recipients. And Republicans in at least nine states have moved to create government efficiency task forces inspired by the initiative helmed by billionaire Elon Musk. Across the country, Republican governors and legislatures are taking advantage of the national spotlight – and friendlier regulatory environment – the Trump administration has created to advance longtime conservative policy goals. In State of the State speeches, X posts and press conferences, they’ve described the new administration as a partner they’re eager to support. And they have been eager to portray themselves as loyal allies. For Democrats, it’s a reminder that elections have consequences at both the federal level and the state level, where Republicans have dominated for years. Republican-backed laws, particularly measures passed in the nearly two dozen states where their party controls the governorship and both chambers of the legislature, have been at the center of some of the biggest culture war fights of the last few years, including the 2022 Dobbs decision that ended federal abortion protections and a pending case on gender-affirming care for minors. Democrats have increasingly pitched the need to build their power at the state level as a way to combat Republican gains. “Red states are feeling even more empowered under Trump’s takeover of Washington to push legislation that sows confusion and chaos, from cutting programs families rely on to rolling back fundamental rights,” said Sam Paisley, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. “Democrats in state legislatures are the strongest defense against MAGA Republicans’ destruction.” Republican lawmakers and governors in a handful of states, including Idaho, New Hampshire, Georgia, Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma have created DOGE task forces or new state legislature committees. More than two dozen Republican governors signed on to a letter last month to GOP congressional leaders backing the effort. The American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative group that drafts model legislation, created a government efficiency coalition after its December national meeting. “The charge was essentially, if DOGE gets it right at the federal level, more things are likely going to be state and local responsibilities,” said Jonathan Williams, ALEC’s president and chief economist. “Our ALEC members really answered the call and said, ‘We also want to discuss these government efficiency ideas and partner with those in Washington that are looking to do the same.’” Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed executive orders last month requiring state employees to work in their offices by July and directing agencies to cut a quarter of regulations by 2029 and look for ways to cut costs. Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed an executive order last week launching a DOGE task force in her state, has described the effort of an extension of the work Iowa began a few years ago. Iowa’s “alignment” process saved the state $217 million in 18 months, Reynolds said last month in her Condition of the State address. “Iowa was doing DOGE before DOGE was a thing,” the governor told a House panel recently. Democrats, however, have pushed back on Reynolds’ portrayal of the state’s work and criticized the governor for signing a 2023 bill restricting the powers of Iowa State Auditor Rob Sand, the only statewide elected Democrat. The law limits the auditor’s access to records and prohibits Sand from suing state agencies for documents – disputes must be settled through arbitration. “We’re happy the governor is interested in government efficiency because we’ve been working on this already for six years,” Sand told CNN. “But the administration’s lip service on this issue of government accountability is a day late and a dollar short.” Even in moments when the administration’s agenda has created concerns over budget shortfalls, Republicans have been slow to criticize the approach in Washington. After the Office of Management and Budget briefly paused federal assistance, Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry and other state leaders asked OMB to “develop a responsible runway to untangle us from any unnecessary and egregious policies without jeopardizing the financial stability of the state.” Trump has also placed an early emphasis on controversial school choice programs. Last month the president signed an executive order directing various agencies to submit plans on how to expand school choice opportunities. Conservatives also expect the administration will roll back Biden-era regulations on school choice programs. School choice advocates also hope Republicans will include provisions allowing for a tax break for donations to scholarship funds that pay for students to attend private schools. “There’s been a vibe shift, in that it’s clear the Department of Education is going to be accommodating, rather than hostile, as states try to enact and implement these policies,” said Frederick Hess, a senior fellow and director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. School choice supporters argue vouchers and other programs allow students to attend better schools or institutions that meet their needs. Opponents argue the programs defund public schools, and that private, religious and charter schools aren’t subject to the same level of oversight as public schools. After a brief power struggle between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican legislature, state lawmakers last week approved a series of immigration enforcement bills that will make it a crime for people who have entered the country illegally to enter Florida, as well as increase funding and staffing to make it easier for state officials to coordinate with federal immigration officials. One new law also ends access to in-state college tuition for young adults who lack legal status. “We here in Florida have a responsibility to be strong partners with the Trump administration,” DeSantis said at a press conference Thursday. In Tennessee, lawmakers passed an immigration enforcement bill this month that would create a new division within the state’s Department of Safety to coordinate with the federal government on immigration enforcement. It would also make it a felony for local officials to adopt so-called sanctuary policies and allow them to be removed from office once convicted. Democrats argued the provision criminalizing “sanctuary city” votes is unconstitutional. The Americans Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee called the legislation “unprecedented” and is challenging it in court. State Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Democrat, advised her national party to do more in states like hers, where Republicans have a supermajority in the legislature that has allowed them to pass legislation that could fuel future court battles. Tennessee GOP House Majority Leader William Lamberth introduced legislation this month that would allow school districts to opt out of educating children who are not in the country legally. Lawmakers have billed the legislation as a chance to overturn a 1982 Supreme Court decision that requires schools to accept all students regardless of legal status. “There needs to be more sense of urgency, and an appetite, for investing in states like Tennessee,” Behn said.\n",

      "Headline: Trump officials fired nuclear staff not realizing they oversee the country’s weapons stockpile, sources say\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/climate/nuclear-nnsa-firings-trump/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Trump administration officials fired more than 300 staffers Thursday night at the National Nuclear Security Administration — the agency tasked with managing the nation’s nuclear stockpile — as part of broader Energy Department layoffs, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. Sources told CNN the officials did not seem to know this agency oversees America’s nuclear weapons. An Energy Department spokesperson disputed the number of personnel affected, telling CNN that “less than 50 people” were “dismissed” from NNSA, and that the dismissed staffers “held primarily administrative and clerical roles.” The agency began rescinding the terminations Friday morning. Some of the fired employees included NNSA staff who are on the ground at facilities where nuclear weapons are built. These staff oversee the contractors who build nuclear weapons, and they inspect these weapons. It also included employees at NNSA headquarters who write requirements and guidelines for contractors who build nuclear weapons. A source told CNN they believe these individuals were fired because “no one has taken anytime to understand what we do and the importance of our work to the nation’s national security.” Members of Congress made their concerns about the NNSA firings known to the Energy Department, a Hill staffer told CNN. A person with knowledge of the matter told CNN that senators visited Energy Sec. Chris Wright to express concern about the NNSA cuts. “Congress is freaking out because it appears DOE didn’t really realize NNSA oversees the nuclear stockpile,” one source said. “The nuclear deterrent is the backbone of American security and stability – period. For there to be any even very small holes poked even in the maintenance of that deterrent should be extremely frightening to people.” NNSA has a total of 1800 staff at facilities around the country. The only probationary staffers exempt from the Thursday-night firings were those who work at its Office of Secure Transportation, the office in charge of driving or otherwise transporting nuclear weapons around the country securely, one person familiar told CNN. “There is strong support on the Hill for NNSA in nuclear modernization writ large,” one source told CNN. “Clearly, NNSA is a critical agency. There have been lawmakers with concerns.” The agency made the about face Friday morning; during a meeting, acting NNSA administrator Teresa Robbins said the agency had received direction to rescind the termination of probationary employees. Probationary workers have typically been employed for less than a year, or two years in some cases, and have fewer job protections and rights to appeal. Robbins added on Friday that if probationary NNSA employees had not yet been fired, their jobs were now safe and all NNSA employees whose access to the agency’s network and internal IT systems was shut off would be turned back on, one source told CNN. The source said Robbins added, “There is a good probability that most or all probationary employees who were fired could return.” Another source cautioned the situation was extremely fluid and said “we don’t know” how many people will be returning. An NNSA spokesperson referred CNN’s questions to DOE. “The Energy Department will continue its critical mission of protecting our national security and nuclear deterrence in the development, modernization, and stewardship of America’s atomic weapons enterprise, including the peaceful use of nuclear technology and nonproliferation,” the DOE spokesperson told CNN. Political officials at the Energy Department told its non-political HR administrators to cite poor performance personnel files as a justification for firing the employees, the source said. Frustrated by the pressure from political appointees, two of those HR employees submitted their resignations on Friday. A DOE spokesperson declined to comment on the poor-performance rationale for the firings. CNN has reached out to the two employees who resigned. In addition to overseeing America’s nuclear weapons, the NNSA also helps secure nuclear material nationwide. Sources told CNN it’s a critical mission, pointing to the Russian drone attack on a Chernobyl power plant reactor in Ukraine on Thursday. “NNSA maintains sensors in Ukraine to help track nuclear risks, whether intentional or unintentional,” a source said, adding the layoffs are “frightening.”\n",

      "Headline: The death of 2 homeless children in frigid Detroit raises questions about a flawed system in peril\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/us/tateona-williams-detroit-homelessness-crisis/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Tateona Williams called the city of Detroit in November for help finding shelter for her family after learning their living arrangement with a relative was no longer working out. But Williams never reached a resolution with the homeless response team, and no one followed up, even after the city opened a new drop-in shelter for families just a few weeks later, its mayor said. This week, two of Williams’ children — ages 2 and 9 — were found dead of apparent hypothermia in a van the family had been sleeping in for at least two months, Interim Police Chief Todd Bettison said. Temperatures dropped below freezing Monday, when Williams had parked on the ninth floor of a casino parking garage. Starting months prior, Williams had “asked everybody for help” for her family. “I called out of state, I called cities I didn’t know, I called cities people asked me to call. I even asked Detroit — I’ve been on CAM list for the longest,” Williams told CNN affiliate WXYZ, referring to the Coordinated Entry system unhoused people are urged to contact in and near Detroit. “Everybody now wants to help after I lost two kids?” The tragedy has the city of Detroit reevaluating how it connects homeless families with shelters, highlighting what national advocates say are broken systems – mostly the responsibility of state and local officials – for helping people experiencing homelessness. It’s also exacerbating fears of what could happen if federal support for people in or on the precipice of homelessness wanes as the fledgling Republican administration of President Donald Trump pushes to slash spending by cutting critical benefits programs that serve the neediest Americans and eliminating key agencies. Many US cities already don’t have enough resources or aren’t deploying them most effectively to meet the needs of their homeless residents, said Donald Whitehead, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. Public officials, meanwhile, have not done enough to address the root causes of homelessness, he said, among them: a shortage of affordable, low-income housing units; landlords driving up rent prices; and a federal minimum wage that stands at $7.25. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development – which supports construction of affordable housing, provides rental assistance to millions, enforces the Fair Housing Act and offers grants to help people experiencing homelessness – in recent weeks has “identified over $260 million in savings,” Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement this week without elaborating on the type of savings. “HUD will be detailed and deliberate about every dollar spent to serve rural, tribal and urban communities,” he said. CNN has reached out to the agency for further comment. If the Trump administration makes cuts to HUD, it would be “outright wrong,” said Steve Berg, chief policy officer for the National Alliance to End Homelessness. “And we know what the result of that is going to be,” he said. “It’s going to be more people living on the street, more people dying on the street.” The death of Williams’ children in Detroit points to a growing national homelessness crisis impacting more families every year, advocates say. An estimated 770,000 people experienced homelessness on a single night in January 2024 – a record high that marked an 18% increase from 2023 – HUD reported. Of those, 64% stayed at shelters and 36% were unsheltered in places not designed for human habitation. One-third of them were in families of at least one adult and one child, the annual survey found, as the number of families with kids experiencing homelessness rose by 39%. At the same time, the country has a shortage of 7.3 million homes affordable and available to renters with extremely low incomes, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. And America faces a housing conundrum: Mortgage rates aren’t falling and home prices are expected to keep rising as Trump, a billionaire property developer, has launched new tariffs and mass deportations that could boost the cost of materials and labor. HUD initiatives like the Section 8 voucher program, which helps low-income families lease affordable privately owned rental housing, are already underfunded and have waiting lists, Berg said. “We need to get people housing … and other services to be stable in the housing,” he said. “None of those are at scale.” For those in need of emergency shelter, some cities lack enough beds, with those in need often put on waiting lists when they have nowhere else to go, Berg said. Other cities have plenty of shelter space but not enough resources to staff hotlines at all hours, Whitehead said, perhaps only answering the phones from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. “People run into crises 24 hours a day,” he said. Further, some unhoused people fear being criminalized if they call police directly for help, Whitehead said. Some cities prohibit people from sleeping in their cars in public places, with jail time or fines threatened, he said. One California city this week voted to criminalize “aiding” and “abetting” homeless camps, an unusual move advocates say could stifle help for people who need it. Many shelters also cater to single adults more than families with children, Whitehead said, noting: “The system was not really designed for families.” The children’s deaths in Detroit have “gotta make us rethink everything that we’re doing,” Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat, said during a news conference this week. “It brings home the point that having services available doesn’t mean very much if the residents who need them don’t know how to access them.” Detroit opened a family drop-in center December 16 to provide shelter for residents just in time for the cold winter months, he said. And residents can call police for help if they face a crisis after 6 p.m. But the city also must give clear options to people when they call about shelters, the mayor said. He also wants a policy that requires outreach workers to do a site visit any time a family with children calls the city for help. “I want that outreach worker face-to-face to identify what the situation is and make sure it is resolved,” Duggan said. For now, a police investigation and an administrative review of the circumstances that led to Williams’ children’s deaths are underway, Detroit spokesman John Roach told CNN. The case, Whitehead said, also should raise awareness of the hurdles people across the country experience when they become homeless – and what’s at stake if the resources available to help them aren’t enough. “We have to continue to ensure that our elected officials understand that we are not talking about statistics, we are talking about people,” he said. “And in the richest country in the history of the world, no one should lose their life because they have a lack of resources to protect them from the elements.”\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/us/ralph-yarl-kansas-city-wrong-house-plea/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Liberty, Missouri (AP) — An 86-year-old Kansas City man pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge in the 2023 shooting of Ralph Yarl, a Black honor student who rang the White man’s doorbell by mistake. Andrew Lester was scheduled to stand trial next week on charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action in the shooting of the then-16-year-old, who survived and has since graduated from high school. As part of a plea deal, Lester pleaded guilty to second-degree assault. Lester, who will be sentenced on March 7, was hunched over as he was wheeled into the courtroom, his hands folded. The charge carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison, compared to first-degree assault, which carries a sentence of 15 to 30 years, depending on the circumstances. One of the key elements of second-degree assault is that defendants “have the burden of injecting the issue of influence of sudden passion arising from adequate cause.” “This is probably perceived as some middle ground, and the heat of passion would be what was the motivation for the shooting,” said J.R. Hobbs, a Kansas City defense attorney who is not involved in the case. “If he was afraid or whatever, it may not rise to a full defense. The parties might agree to that because on one hand, it’s a felony conviction — no trial, no possible appeal. On the other hand, with a lesser statutory limit, the defendant’s exposure is less as well.” Yarl showed up on Lester’s doorstep on the night of April 13, 2023, after he mixed up the streets where he was supposed to pick up his twin siblings. Lester’s attorney, Steve Salmon, has long argued that Lester was acting in self-defense and that he was terrified by the stranger who knocked on his door as he settled into bed. Authorities say Lester shot Yarl twice: first in the head, then in the arm. The shooting shocked the country and renewed national debate about gun policies and race in the US. Yarl testified at an earlier hearing that he rang the bell and then waited for someone to answer for what seemed “longer than normal.” As the inner door opened, Yarl said, he reached out to grab the storm door. “I assume these are my brothers’ friends’ parents,” he said. He said Lester shot him in the head and uttered, “Don’t come here ever again.” Although the bullet didn’t penetrate Yarl’s brain, the impact knocked him to the ground. Yarl said Lester then shot him in the arm. The teen was taken to the hospital and released three days later. His family said the shooting took a big emotional toll and they have filed a lawsuit against the retired aircraft mechanic. Salmon said last year that Lester’s physical and mental condition had deteriorated. He said Lester has had heart issues, a broken hip and has been hospitalized. Lester also has lost 50 pounds (23 kilograms), which Salmon blamed on the stress of intense media coverage and death threats he subsequently received. A judge had previously ordered a mental evaluation of Lester but allowed for the trial to proceed after its completion. The results of that evaluation were not released publicly.\n",

      "Headline: Black Hawk helicopter’s altimeter may have been inaccurate\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/us/black-hawk-altimeter-missed-tower-calls/index.html\n",
      "Summary: A preliminary analysis of the flight data and voice recorder on board a Black Hawk helicopter leading up to the collision with a commercial flight over Washington, DC, on January 29, indicated the helicopter’s altimeter may have been inaccurate and the pilots may not have heard some calls from the Reagan National Airport control tower, officials said. The new data indicate the pilot and her instructor read out two different altitudes shortly before the crash, National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters at a briefing Friday. The radio altimeter on board the Black Hawk at the time of the deadly midair collision read 278 feet, Homendy said. That altimeter uses a radio beam to show the helicopter’s altitude above ground level, but it may not have been what the pilots of the helicopter were referencing at the time of the crash, Homendy noted. The newly revealed data suggests the Army helicopter crew may not have realized they were flying higher than they were supposed to be when the aircraft collided with American Airlines Flight 5342 more than two weeks ago, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft. The Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, based at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, was flying a training mission in a dedicated helicopter route where it was not allowed to fly above 200 feet, according to a published FAA chart. “What we don’t want to do is release radio altitude data so that people would blame the Black Hawk crew,” Homendy told CNN. “We need to know what they were seeing, and we can’t know that right now with the data we have, but we will get it.” Homendy cautioned the information is preliminary and there are “inconsistencies” in the data. “It might not have been what the Black Hawk crew was seeing,” Homendy told CNN Friday. Homendy said the agency is trying to verify all the components of the helicopter. “We are seeing conflicting information in the data, which is why we aren’t releasing altitude for the Black Hawk’s entire route,” Homendy said. Determining the Black Hawk’s precise altitude at the time of the collision is seen as a crucial step in understanding how two aircraft collided under clear skies over some of the country’s most tightly controlled airspace. Prior to the collision, the instructor pilot on board and the pilot flying the helicopter read out two different altitudes, and investigators are trying to determine why, Homendy said. “Neither pilot made a comment discussing an altitude discrepancy,” Homendy said at the briefing. “At this time, we don’t know why there was a discrepancy between the two.” The last radio altitude recorded for the regional jet was 313 feet, two seconds before the collision, according to Homendy. One second before impact, the regional jet began to increase its pitch, or the up and down movement of a plane’s nose, reaching about nine degrees nose up at the time of collision, Homendy said, explaining the pilots on the regional jet saw something was about to happen before the collision. There was no any indication, however, the Black Hawk crew saw the possibility of a collision unfolding in front of them. Investigators are looking into the systems to account for the discrepancy, she added, but it will “take a significant amount of work.” They’ll collaborate with manufacturers of the equipment and the army, Homendy said. After comparing voice recordings from the control tower and the Black Hawk, investigators believe the helicopter pilots may not have heard some of the instructions from the tower. In particular, 17 seconds before the collision, the tower told the helicopter to pass behind the commuter jet. But in the audio from the helicopter’s voice recorder, the instruction was not heard, possibly because the pilots had keyed their microphone to reach the tower at the same time. Additionally, the audio indicates the Black Hawk crew many not have received an earlier transmission that the regional jet was “circling” to the runway. More than two weeks after the collision, investigators are continuing to examine the wreckage and flight data from both aircraft to reconstruct the events leading to the crash. “This is not going to be an easy task,” Peter Goelz, former managing director of the NTSB, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar Friday afternoon. “It’s a hard job to figure out how this helicopter was off course.” To determine the altitude the pilots saw on their gauges as they were flying, investigators will examine the remains of the pitot-static system and air data computer, said NTSB vehicle recorder division Branch Chief Sean Payne Friday. Evaluating the altimeters themselves and determining their independent functionality will be another piece of the puzzle. They’ll also review engineering documentation to understand how “bad data” may have affected other helicopter systems, Payne said. Barometric altitude, which is typically the altitude the pilots would reference while they are flying, was not recorded on the flight data recorder. Normally, investigators would be able to use pressure altitude to compute the barometric altitude displayed to the pilots. Because the pressure altitude parameter is invalid, they have to use other methods to make that determination, NTSB officials said. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from both aircraft are currently being examined in the NTSB laboratories. Investigators are also examining the wreckage to determine the exact angle of the collision, Homendy said. The black box voice recorder from the Black Hawk helicopter was recovered on January 31 with no signs of exterior damage. The helicopter had a combined cockpit voice recorder and digital flight data recorder. The cockpit voice recorder of the American Airlines regional jet had sustained water intrusion, the NTSB previously reported. It was recovered on January 30 and then soaked overnight in ionized water, then put in a vacuum oven to extract moisture. The plane’s flight data recorder was found in “good condition,” according to lead investigator Todd Inman. The NTSB also believes the helicopter crew was “likely” wearing night vision goggles while performing a check ride, or a practical exam. The Army does three types of check rides: instrument, annual and night vision goggles. This ride was a combined annual and night vision goggle check ride. The night vision goggles could have further complicated the situation, requiring the crew to constantly be scanning left and right to get peripheral vision, Goelz said. They can also cause confusion in a crowded airspace within an urban area where there is a lot of lighting. The NTSB is conducting a visibility study, which will laser scan models of the cockpits of both aircraft, which could help aid investigators with what pilots on the Black Hawk could see. Homendy also addressed the Black Hawk helicopter’s equipment for tracking air traffic and the speculation surrounding it, as lawmakers gave mixed signals on whether the helicopter had it in the first place. Civilian and military aircraft use a technology called automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), which helps an aircraft broadcast its location, altitude, and other key factors while monitoring other aircraft around it. Homendy confirmed the helicopter had the necessary equipment and was capable of transmitting, but investigators are still unclear why it was not transmitting. “What we’ll have to look at is the installation of the equipment. We’ll have to look at programming,” Homendy said. “We’ll have to look at whether there was some sort of equipment malfunction, or if the ADS-B was turned off.” The analysis comes about a week after the NTSB, along with the Naval Sea Systems Command Supervisor of Salvage and Diving, lifted much of the Black Hawk and other large portions of wreckage from the river. Homendy said the agency has completed its work at the scene of the crash and is continuing its analysis of the physical evidence. “I am 100% confident that we will get to the bottom of this,” Homendy said. A preliminary report on the crash is expected to be released by the end of the month. Now that the NTSB has completed the on-scene phase of the investigation, the board will focus on fact-finding, Homendy said. This story has been updated with additional information.\n",

      "Headline: European leaders to hold emergency summit on Ukraine as Trump peace push leaves them isolated\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/europe/europe-emergency-summit-ukraine-intl-latam/index.html\n",
      "Summary: European leaders will hold an emergency summit on Ukraine Monday amid growing concern that the Trump administration’s push to work with Russia to end the war has left them isolated. The continent has been scrambling to respond after US President Donald Trump announced negotiations would begin “immediately” on ending the conflict following a phone call with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, and Trump’s Russia-Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg saying Europe would not be involved. The summit was confirmed by the Elysée Palace, which said French President Emmanuel Macron would hold an “informal” meeting Monday with “the heads of government of Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark, as well as the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission and the Secretary General of NATO.” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it a “once in a generation” moment for national security. “The UK will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together,” Starmer was quoted as saying in a statement released by Downing Street on Saturday. “We cannot allow any divisions in the alliance to distract from the external enemies we face.” News of the emergency summit follows US President Donald Trump and his top officials upending in recent days what had largely been a united front between Washington and its European NATO allies on supporting Ukraine against Russia’s invasion, which is nearing its third anniversary. Trump spoke with both Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, while his top administration officials visited Europe and presented elements of a vision for ending the war that appeared to allow for key concessions to Russia and raised fears that Ukraine could be marginalized and Europe left out of peacemaking. The European diplomatic efforts come after new US Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth, speaking in Brussels on Wednesday, said it was unrealistic that Kyiv should join NATO or return to its pre-2014 sovereign borders – an apparent break with Washington’s previous stance and one that critics said gave key concessions to Putin before talks even began. A day later, Hegseth hedged on those comments, saying “everything is on the table” in negotiations between the two countries. US Vice President JD Vance also warned Thursday the US could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Moscow doesn’t negotiate a peace deal in good faith. Kellogg said in Munich that Ukraine would be at the table for peace negotiations. But while other European governments’ positions would be taken into consideration, Kellogg said, they would not be participants. Trump has long been critical of NATO, calling for European partners to spend more on defense and decrying what he sees as an unbalanced relationship between the two sides of the Atlantic with little benefit to the US. Vance also played into concerns of a deepening breach between Europe and the US under Trump while in Munich on Friday. In a speech, he reprimanded European leaders, telling them that the biggest threat to their security was “from within,” rather than China or Russia, and pointing to what he claimed was their suppression of free speech and refusal to work with hard-right parties in government. In a post on X Sunday, Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said the bloc would   “soon come up with new initiatives” on supporting Ukraine and bolstering European security. The US appears tis moving ahead with its own peace process, with administration figures  set to meet with senior Russian officials to begin talks aimed at ending the war, according to multiple sources. National security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to travel to Saudi Arabia for the meeting, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN. One of the sources said the meeting will take place in the coming days. The sources declined to say which Russian officials would be in attendance, but CNN has previously reported the Kremlin is assembling a high-level negotiating team to engage in direct talks with the US, including top-level political, intelligence and economic figures, and Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian official who played a key behind-the-scenes role in a recent US prisoner release deal. Trump’s call with Putin and the push to work with Russia have also raised Ukrainian fears of being excluded from talks deciding the fate of their own country. Zelensky in recent days lamented that the US president spoke with Putin before him. Speaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on stage at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky conceded that he was “not happy” that Trump’s first call was with Putin. The Ukrainian leader warned that it would be even “more dangerous” however if Trump meets in person with the Russian president before him. Trump hasn’t provided any commitment to meeting Zelensky first, the Ukrainian president told CNN. The US president did however understand the need to “meet urgently” to discuss “concrete plans” to end the war, Zelensky added. Zelensky sat down with Vance Friday in Munich for what the Ukrainian leader later called a “substantive meeting.” The following day, in an address to the security conference, Zelensky said his country “will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe.” The wartime Ukrainian leader also referenced the potential for Europe to be excluded from the new peace push. “A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin. Not once did he mention that America needs Europe at that table. That says a lot,” he said. This story has been updated.\n",

      "Summary: Top Trump administration officials are set to meet with senior Russian officials to begin talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, according to multiple sources. National security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff are expected to travel to Saudi Arabia for the meeting with senior Russian officials, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN. One of the sources said the meeting will take place in the coming days. The sources declined to say which Russian officials would be in attendance, but CNN has previously reported the Kremlin is assembling a high-level negotiating team to engage in direct talks with the US, including top-level political, intelligence and economic figures, and Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian official who played a key behind-the-scenes role in a recent US prisoner release deal. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that negotiations to end the nearly three-year Ukraine war will start “immediately” after holding a “lengthy and highly productive” phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The call, which was the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul also confirmed the plans during an interview with Politico at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, saying, “Rubio and Waltz and Witkoff (are) being dispatched to Saudi to talk to the Ukrainians and the Russians about Ukraine.” Trump indicated earlier this week that he could meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia in the “not-too-distant future,” but cautioned that no formal decision had been made. “We think we’re going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia, the first meeting,” Trump said after he spoke to Putin by phone Wednesday. The president indicated that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would play a role in the discussions. Witkoff also said the Saudi crown prince was “instrumental” in the release of wrongfully detained American Marc Fogel this week. The State Department had previously announced Rubio would travel to Saudi Arabia in the coming days as part of a larger trip to Munich and the Middle East. Rubio, who landed in Israel on Saturday, held a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier in the day, the State Department said in a statement. “The Secretary re-affirmed President Trump’s commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. “In addition, they discussed the opportunity to potentially work together on a number of other bilateral issues.” The Russian Foreign Ministry characterized the Lavrov-Rubio conversation as “a mutual commitment to cooperate on current international issues, including the resolution of the situation around Ukraine” as well the Middle East crisis. The two agreed to maintain regular contact, including to prepare for a high-level Russian-American meeting, the ministry said. Rubio’s call comes as the Trump administration’s Russia-Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said Saturday that Moscow would have to make concessions to end the war in Ukraine. The concessions would primarily involve territorial matters and possibly the renunciation of the use of force, Kellogg told a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference. Putin is “not going to downsize his military forces,” the American diplomat said, but the US hopes “to force” him into actions he is “uncomfortable with.” Kellogg said the US could achieve this by disrupting Russia’s recently formed alliances — such as those with Iran, North Korea and China — that didn’t exist just a few years ago. Kellogg also said the US could put pressure on Putin’s oil revenue through stricter sanctions. “What is driving Russia? It’s really a petrostate. Seventy percent of the money they are getting to fund this war is coming from petro, oil and gas,” Kellogg noted, adding that the US must start employing sanctions that break Moscow’s “economic back.” Trump has previously demurred when asked what concessions Russia should have to make to end the war in Ukraine. “It’s too early to say what’s going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot. Maybe they won’t. It’s all dependent on what is going to happen,” he said Thursday. Kellogg also said Saturday that Europeans will not be at the negotiating table when trying to reach a solution to the war in Ukraine. “The answer is no,” Kellogg said at an event on the margins of the Munich Security Conference. The Ukrainians will be present “of course,” Kellogg said. “It would be foolish to say (Ukraine) wouldn’t.” As for the Europeans, Kellogg said that he comes from a “school of realism” and that looking back at the previous Minsk II agreement, “there was a lot of people at the table that really had no ability to execute some type of peace process, and it failed miserably.” The Minsk II agreement was negotiated in the Belarusian capital in 2015 in a bid to end a bloody 10-month conflict in eastern Ukraine. The rare diplomatic effort brought together leaders from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France, aiming to restore peace in regions seized by pro-Russian separatists in 2014. Despite its ambitious goals, the agreement faced challenges in implementation, ultimately failing to bring lasting stability to the region. Kellogg described the current efforts at negotiating a peace deal as “dual track.” “You got a Russian track going on. At the same time, we’ve got a Ukrainian track going on,” he said. “So if you look at the news you see that you got the (Trump) envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff is involved because he’s got the Russian line. And I’m working American-Ukrainian allied line as well. We’re doing that for speed.” This story has been updated with additional information.

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/india/india-crowd-crush-delhi-train-mela-int-latam/index.html\n",
      "Summary: At least 18 people were killed in a crowd crush at a New Delhi railway station Saturday as passengers tried to board trains heading to the world’s largest religious gathering, according to local media citing police. “18 people including 9 women and 5 children lost their lives in the stampede that occurred yesterday around 10 p.m. at New Delhi Railway station,” Delhi police told CNN affiliate CNN-News18 in a statement. Deputy commissioner of Delhi police KPS Malhotra told India’s ANI news that the crush took place late Saturday night, when delays to two train services and an influx of passengers led to overcrowding. He said the “situation went out of control for a brief spell of 10 to 15 minutes.” Many of those in the crowds are thought to have been heading to the Maha Kumbh Mela, the world’s largest religious gathering, in the Indian city of Prayagraj. The news comes just weeks after dozens of people were killed in a crowd crush at the gathering itself. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “distressed” at the latest deaths. “My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected,” Modi wrote on X Sunday. Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union Minister of Railways of India, said on X that he was “deeply saddened by the unfortunate” crowd crush. “My prayers are with all those who have lost their loved ones. The entire team is working to assist all those who have been affected by this tragic incident,” he wrote. Vaishnaw said four trains had been used to evacuate people from the station. Police were on the scene and the situation was now under control, he added. The festival is considered the world’s largest peaceful gathering of people. Over six weeks, a staggering 400 million people are expected to attend the Maha Kumbh Mela, or the festival of the Sacred Pitcher, on the banks of Prayagraj.\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/europe/austria-stabbing-suspect-islamist-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: The Syrian asylum seeker suspected of carrying out a deadly stabbing rampage in the Austrian town of Villach is believed to be a follower of Islamic State who was radicalized online, authorities said on Sunday. A 14-year-old boy was killed in Saturday’s attack and five other people were wounded, police said at a press conference. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said the 23-year-old Syrian man arrested soon after the attack had been rapidly radicalized on the internet and that the Islamic State (IS) flag had been found in his apartment. Authorities said the man had sworn an oath of allegiance to IS. The bloodshed in Villach followed the thwarting of a plot in August to carry out a suicide attack at a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna by a teenager who had sworn loyalty to IS. Saturday’s rampage also came just days after an attack on Thursday in Munich in neighboring Germany by an Afghan national who drove his car into a crowd, injuring dozens of people, two of whom later died. It took place at a time of political tension in Austria, where the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) - which won September’s parliamentary election - said last week it was unable to form a coalition government. Centrist parties are now discussing whether they could try to form a government while the president considers options including moving the country towards a snap election. Railing against illegal immigration and pledging to increase deportations to countries such as Syria and Afghanistan, which it is currently illegal to deport people to, are central to the FPO’s platform, and the party quickly seized on the Villach attack. “No migrant would be able to commit murder or any other crime in our country if they were not in Austria in the first place,” FPO leader Herbert Kickl said in a statement posted on social media.\n",

      "Summary: One of Earth’s deepest mysteries lies beneath our feet: the planet’s inner core. Made of iron and nickel, the hot, solid sphere is about 70% the size of the moon. Recent research suggested this dense center reversed its spin, and now, scientists have also found evidence that the shape of the inner core is changing. Scientists inferred signs of deformation from earthquakes strong enough to reach the planet’s heart. But never fear — this shape-shifting won’t directly affect life on Earth. Over time, changes to this innermost layer could impact the planet’s magnetic field, which shields our world from solar radiation — and helps guide the migrations of many animals. Loggerhead sea turtles make impressive migratory treks across oceans — and they have a superpower that guides them to nesting and feeding areas with nary a landmark in sight. The turtles rely on Earth’s magnetic field to help them navigate in two ways. A magnetic map aids with location tracking, and a magnetic compass orients them in the right direction. Now, a new study has shown loggerheads actually memorize magnetic fields to help them find foods after migrating. In fact, captive juvenile loggerheads will “dance” in a particular movement pattern in response to magnetic cues that remind them where they previously partook in meals — and the cute motion is something you have to see to believe. Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been on the International Space Station since June after piloting Boeing Starliner’s first crewed test flight, may be coming home a bit sooner than planned. NASA is aiming to put the duo on a return flight to Earth as soon as mid-March. It’s a time of change at the agency, where employees have expressed concerns due to the Trump administration’s directives over anti-diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility communications. NASA shared that the Space Launch System megarocket, which first flew in 2022, is “essential” to the Artemis moon landing program, even as Boeing has announced layoffs connected to the program. Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos’ rocket company Blue Origin said it plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees shortly after it debuted its first orbital rocket, New Glenn. Astronomers detected the highest-energy cosmic “ghost particle” ever found in an unlikely place: the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The KM3NeT Collaboration has been building a giant network of sensors in the deep sea near Toulon, France, and Capo Passero, Italy, for about a decade to detect neutrinos. The particles can pass through any kind of matter and contain information about some of the most energetic events in the universe, such as gamma-ray bursts. When a powerful neutrino traveled through the partly finished ARCA detector off the coast of Italy, it set off sensors with its bluish light. Now, researchers are trying to figure out what extreme astronomical event created the particle and sent it flying toward Earth. Separately, a test image captured by the Euclid space telescope revealed a startingly detailed look at a rare cosmic phenomenon known as an Einstein ring, the light of a distant galaxy creating a glowing ring around a nearby one. An analysis of bones of ancient humans recovered from a cave near Kraków, Poland, suggest early Europeans may have dined on the brains of their enemies. Researchers studied remains of 10 individuals from the Magdalenian culture who lived in Europe between 11,000 and 17,000 years ago. The bones had marks and cuts suggesting the removal of bone marrow and brain matter. Previous research suggested cannibalism was common among the Magdalenians, and they practiced it as a funerary rite. But the skulls in this instance showed it “was a case of warfare,” said archaeologist Francesc Marginedas of the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Spain. Speaking of brains, scientists identified a fungus that lures cave spiders from their webs and turns them into “zombies.” The fungus first came to light when a television crew was filming inside an abandoned gunpowder storeroom at Northern Ireland’s Castle Espie Wetland Centre in 2021. The crew spotted an orb weaver spider acting in an unusual manner, suggesting something had altered its behavior. The fungus, named Gibellula attenboroughii, infects and kills the spiders, then uses the arachnid’s body to spread its spores. But researchers are still trying to understand exactly how the fungus alters and affects the brains of spiders to control them. Linger over these fresh finds with your morning beverage: — Astronomers discovered a monster radio jet formed during the early days of the universe, and it’s the largest known celestial object of its kind in the distant cosmos. — Unprovoked shark attacks declined sharply in 2024 around the world, according to a new report.

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/africa/drc-rebels-advance-on-bukavu-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Rebel forces have been seen in the center of Bukavu, the second largest city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), on Sunday, residents told CNN, as the fighters push to expand their foothold in the mineral-rich region. Rebel coalition, Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), which includes the M23 armed group, said in a statement Saturday it had taken control of the Kavumu airport in South Kivu and forced government forces to retreat “in disarray, abandoning the city of Bukavu.” Bukavu is the provincial capital, where residents also reported looting and fighters in the streets Saturday. “We have control of Bukavu since this morning,” a spokesperson for the AFC rebel alliance, Victor Tesongo, told CNN Sunday. The DRC government has not confirmed the claimed takeover. CNN has approached authorities for comment on the rebels’ claims. Bukavu resident Elie Cirhuza told CNN he saw M23 fighters on the streets Sunday. “I saw with my eyes the soldiers of the M23. They say they will soon begin to restore order in the city,” said Cirhuza, who lives close to the city center. He said that government troops were nowhere in sight. “I have not yet seen any government soldiers because downstairs from my house is where they gathered the night before yesterday to flee,” Cirhuza added. A DRC military spokesperson, Sylvain Ekenge Ekenge, told Reuters on Friday that government forces had retreated from Bukavu after the rebels occupied the airport. Another resident, Isaac Musharhamina Goldman, said the rebels have occupied strategic points in the city, including the provincial governor’s office and residence. “They are in the three communes of the city, including the office and residence of the governor of the province, the Saïo military camp, and the site of the National Communication and Satellite Network,” he said. “They also control the two border entrances.” According to local reports, provincial governor Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki left Bukavu before the rebels advanced into the city. CNN has reached out to him for comment. The rapid advance into Bukavu comes less than three weeks after the rebels claimed the takeover of Goma, the largest city and capital of the neighboring North Kivu province on January 27. Fighting in Goma between the rebels and DRC’s military left more than 3,000 people dead, according to the government. Rebel spokesman Tesongo told CNN that the claimed capture of Goma and Bukavu marked the group’s largest territorial acquisition. The cities, with a joint population of more than three million people, are among the most populated in the DRC. The DRC and many Western countries accuse its neighbor Rwanda of backing M23, which is comprised mainly of ethnic Tutsis who left the Congolese army more than a decade ago. Rwandan President Paul Kagame, however, told CNN this month he was unaware whether his nation’s troops were in DRC. Since 2022, M23 – which claims to defend the interest of minority Rwandophone communities, including the Tutsis – has waged a renewed rebellion against the DRC government, occupying a large expanse in North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda. Now a part of the AFC rebel alliance, the group has also taken over resource-rich communities in the east such as Nyabibwe and Rubaya, which harbors one of the world’s largest deposits of coltan, a valuable mineral used in the production of smartphones. Calls for a ceasefire from foreign and regional leaders have failed to deter the rebels’ quest for territory.\n",

      "Headline: This uncomfortable portrait of femininity has resonated for four decades\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/style/jo-ann-callis-blue-bow-photography-snap/index.html\n",
      "Summary: In 1977, Jo Ann Callis took a photograph of a woman’s head thrown back, her neck taut and tied with a bow looped together from the thin baby blue straps of her white lace dress. It’s an image that beckons a long look, as the tension heightens in its stillness: the woman’s exposed neck strains at the angle, a light red marking peeking out near the tightly bound choker thread. Just above her shoulder, two wallpaper birds dive together, their beaks nearly touching in either an amorous or aggressive dance. Though she made the image four and a half decades ago, “Woman with Blue Bow” seems strikingly contemporary — a timeless symbol on the strictures of femininity. It is currently exhibiting in the group show “Del Cielo” at Rosegallery in Santa Monica, California, but has been featured in Callis’ exhibitions over the decades as well as her 2009 book, “Woman Twirling.” Callis is a pioneer of both staged photography and color film in fine art, with her early work depicting shadowy, intensely psychological portraits of women. Her subjects are often kept anonymous through turned heads and cropped frames. They are images with undercurrents of desire and unease: In one, a man’s hands grab the ankles of a woman in heels standing on a chair; in another, a blonde woman is seen from behind and above in bed, her body divided by a single black line that begins with the part in her hair and continues down her spine. “All those pictures seem to have a sense of pleasure,” Callis explained in a phone interview. “But it goes back and forth between discomfort and comfort.” In “Blue Bow,” the model poses with her face away from the camera —  “a woman standing for all women,” Callis said. Recently divorced at the time she took the photo, Callis was thinking of the limitations that she had experienced in her life, and the restrictive expectations of her gender. She had returned to graduate school for photography while raising her two young children. “The world opened up to me,” she recalled, explaining that she’d painted and sculpted at home until then. “When I went back to school, I felt so liberated… So that’s, you know, so that’s what that work was about, just freedom and constraint.” Callis made her early color work at the peak of the feminist art movement, as artists including Cindy Sherman, Hannah Wilke and Ana Mendieta were exploring gender, power and politics through images of the female body. Though Callis and her body of work fits neatly within this cohort, it’s not a label that Callis adopted, then or now. “But of course, I guess I am,” she added. She made “Blue Bow” thinking of her own years as a teenager in the 1950s, when it was standard for women to wear crinolines under dresses — garments “which were terribly uncomfortable,” she noted — and, sometimes, ribbons around the neck for formal occasions. Other constraining fashions came to mind too, from the centuries-long tradition of foot binding in China to more subtle limitations of mobility in garments like pencil skirts, all keeping women’s fashion in line with gendered social expectations. The red imprint on the model’s neck, alluding to discomfort, was not actually caused by the bow, Callis explained, but was rather an illusion thanks to makeup. It’s just one of the many nuances in her color work that she would not have been able to pull off in black and white. At the time, however, color photography was still seen as gauche in fine art circles, with William Eggleston’s landmark exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, “Photographs” stirring controversy for its snapshot-like color scenes the year prior. Like Eggleston and later, the filmmaker David Lynch, among others, Callis saw the potential in tapping into lurid hues that could transform the mood of an image. She was greatly inspired by the images of Paul Outerbridge, who lensed full-color erotic portraits of nude women in the 1930s, decades ahead of his time. “I thought color would add another emotional element to the work,” she said. “I like sour colors — beautiful, but a little bit off. That’s still the palette I like.” The cinematic qualities of her work are a nod to filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, who also influenced her aesthetic. But she has, in turn, been a source of inspiration for both staged photography as well as filmmaking — notably, Sofia Coppola has cited “Blue Bow” as a photograph she kept returning to in the making of her 2017 film “The Beguiled,” about a Civil War-era school for girls. “It fits the feeling in ‘The Beguiled’ of frustration and being trapped in ultra-femininity,” Coppola wrote of the photograph in her recent book “Archive.” The fact that Callis’ image has such staying power is “discouraging, in some ways, that things haven’t changed enough,” Callis said. “In contemporary relationships there is more equality, but not always. Women are often the ones who take care of the home and the cooking, even if they’re working.” But another theme in her image remains lasting, too, seen in the tension between photographer and subject, and the two birds frozen as they come together, mirrored in their symmetry. “When you’re in a relationship, it’s a give and take,” she said. “You’re always giving up something in order to get something else.”\n",

      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/sport/kasparov-karpov-1984-85-world-championship-spt-intl/index.html\n",
      "Summary: Russian-born chess grandmaster and émigré Gennadi “Genna” Sosonko still remembers where he was 40 years ago today, when he heard that the 1984-85 World Championship match in Moscow between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov had been abandoned. “I couldn’t come to the Soviet Union, of course. I was an enemy as (far as they were) concerned,” he says in an interview with CNN Sport. “I remember that day very well because I was in Switzerland, and I was together with (dissident and fellow grandmaster) Viktor Korchnoi, helping him to prepare for one of his own matches. We were listening to the Swiss radio, we were analyzing the opposition, when we heard that (FIDE President Florencio) Campomanes stopped the match. ‘Well, well, well, how is this possible?’” The match had lasted five months, longer than any other World Championship before or since. Somewhere along the way, the contest had picked up some sort of symbolic value, an understanding that the result would reflect the future of the Soviet Union as a whole. If Karpov won, it would be a sign of life for the old guard in a country which seemed to be slipping towards inevitable dissolution. If Kasparov won, it would be confirmation that times were changing, that something fresh and exciting and terrifying was coming. But to be abandoned, without a winner, after 48 grueling games? What did that mean? In terms of popularity, chess in the Soviet Union was akin to the NFL in the US. “It was more than just a kind of sport,” says Sosonko. “Chess in Russia was a kind of religion. It was much more than just a game with 64 squares and 32 pieces. “The names of Karpov, the names of (Mikhail) Tal, (Tigran) Petrosian and others were known by everybody, even the people who never played chess.” The dominance enjoyed by Soviet players during the second half of the 20th century is hard to overstate. FIDE organized its first World Championship in 1948, and from then until the end of the century, 23 championship matches were played. Only one was not won by a Soviet or former-Soviet citizen – Bobby Fischer in 1972. Under the likes of Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov, the Soviet Union was well-known for its extensive use of propaganda, including the promotion of elite sportspeople like ice hockey star Vladislav Tretiak and soccer goalkeeper Lev Yashin. With the Cold War bubbling away and the USSR looking for any opportunity to promote Soviet ideals on the world stage, chess players were no different. Their supremacy in the sport was fueled, in part, by the fact that they were looked after exceptionally well by the state. “The conditions for the players were such that you couldn’t compare it with the tournaments in the West,” Sosonko recalls. “They had ﻿carte blanche in all restaurants, all hotels, unbelievable fees in dollars and hard currency. It was absolutely phenomenal in the Soviet Union.” By the time 1984 came around, Karpov – a three-time world champion and a symbol of Soviet ideals – had been the prized asset for a decade. “He was a really Russian guy from Ural, and he represented our country with glamor, with everything and so on,” explains Sosonko. “He was a god in Russia.” As one of the few Soviet players who was able to play tournaments abroad and collect prize money in the local currency, Karpov was also “one of the richest people in the country,” according to Sosonko. “He was one of the three or maybe four people in all of the Soviet Union who got a Mercedes car. One was Brezhnev, (singer Vladimir) Vysotsky, and the third one was Anatoly Karpov. “The privileges that he got, you cannot imagine. He couldn’t compare with anybody in Russia.” Kasparov, on the other hand, could not have been viewed more differently. “He had a couple of weaknesses in the eyes of the big Party guys and the sport committee,” says Sosonko. “Namely, he was not a Russian, he was half-Jew and half-Armenian, and he came from Baku. The Soviet Union was very antisemitic.” Despite having some ties to the Azerbaijani Communist Party’s First Secretary – and future president of Azerbaijan – Heydar Aliyev, the young challenger was not nearly as loyal to the Party as Karpov. “Even at that time in the Soviet Union, everybody knew that Kasparov was young, ambitious. Not a dissident, but someone who was representative of the new wave,” says Sosonko. “His friends were actors, not dissidents – however, dissidents as well – but people who were not for the regime. (Whereas) Karpov was a really hard guard of the Soviet society at that time.” Karpov’s conservatism and Kasparov’s radical nature were both present in their chess. “There was something of a clash of titans here, in stylistic view,” Andrew Soltis, American grandmaster and chess historian, tells CNN Sport. “Kasparov represented a more aggressive, dynamic style. “He was a contrast with Karpov, who was somewhat more conservative. He played a waiting game often. He specialized in improving his position gradually until it became overwhelming. Karpov rarely won a game in fewer than 30 moves. Kasparov reveled in winning games very quickly. “No one was indifferent. You were either a Karpov fan or a Kasparov fan. There was no middle ground.” Played under the competition’s old rules, where the champion is the first to win six games and draws are worth nothing, the 1984 World Chess Championship began on September 10. Nine games and 25 days in, Karpov had established a seemingly unassailable 4-0 lead. As Kasparov began to get more of a handle on the match, the next 17 games were drawn, before Karpov won again in game 27 to put himself one win away from victory. But the champion was not playing like he had been at the start of the match. He had started to make mistakes and, in game 32, Kasparov finally notched a victory. “Karpov thought that he could win the match just by sitting back and waiting for his opponent to blunder, and that may have worked at the beginning, but Kasparov recovered remarkably. He didn’t emotionally collapse the way many of Karpov’s opponents did,” explains Soltis. “Eventually, the strain got to Karpov and he began to make really bad moves. He became unnerved.” The next 14 games were tied, but in games 47 and 48, Kasparov won two in a row to pull the score back to 5-3. Suddenly, Karpov was floundering. Was his opponent really about to come back and win the match? “Definitely, the momentum had shifted to Kasparov,” says Soltis. “I think he would probably have at least gotten to a situation where they both had five victories. And the final, if that happened, I would have bet heavily on Kasparov. I think that Karpov had become a shell of the player that he once was. “The Karpov that began that match in 1984 was not the Karpov that ended the match in 1985.” The intensity of the situation was apparently getting to the reigning champion, who lost 22 pounds over the course of the match. “Karpov was obviously getting very tired. He was exhausted. He wasn’t sleeping well. According to his aides, he was getting to sleep at midnight early in the match, and then it was 2 a.m. and then it was 4 a.m. He was clearly getting weaker and weaker,” says Soltis. “(He) wasn’t very heavy to begin with. He’s a small guy, relatively, and he was just wasting away.” It was at this point, with Kasparov apparently having turned the tide and both players keen to continue, that Campomanes took one of the most infamous decisions in chess history. He flew to Moscow and, citing the health of the players, announced that he was abandoning the match. The ruling, he added, was supported by the Soviet Chess Federation. In the 40 years since, there has never been a definitive answer as to whether Campomanes – who has since been referred to as “Karpovmanes” in some circles – had any ulterior motive when he made the decision. In Sosonko’s mind, the reasoning is clear. “FIDE, the international chess organization, was completely under the influence of the Soviet Union,” he says. “We knew, of course, that Campomanes was on the side of the Soviets.” When contacted for comment, current FIDE CEO Emil Sutovsky told CNN that Sosonko’s claims were “rather inaccurate.” While admitting that the Soviets did have a lot of influence, he pointed out that there was a lot of tension between FIDE and the USSR Chess Federation, particularly between 1983 and 1985. There have even been suggestions from some that Campomanes, who passed away in 2010, was an agent of the KGB, an argument Sosonko believes is an oversimplification. “‘KGB agent’ is a hard definition – that he got some money or some instructions. I don’t think so. But he was on the Soviet side, in all aspects,” he says. Soltis points out that Campomanes had previously taken decisions in other tournaments that had hindered Soviet players and calls the notion that Campomanes was KGB “absurd.” However, he does also believe that decisions throughout the match seemed to favor Karpov. “The postponements, I think, were the critical point here,” he explains. “Normally, players can ask for a postponement of a game in those days because of illness, and the players had exhausted their number of days they could take. And then there were these mysterious postponements that the government or the chess officials ordered. “There was no real explanation. So there was this invisible hand that was benefiting Karpov.” There was, recalls Soltis, a shift in the FIDE President’s reputation during the match: “At one point, it seemed like Campomanes was standing firm, that he was an enemy of the Soviets. “But during this match, the perception changed, and it would seem that Campomanes was actually playing a double game. He was really helping Karpov, he was helping the Soviet Chess Federation which really wanted to get this thing over with, and he was trying to find a solution. “Nobody knows what’s going on in Campomanes’ mind, and he’s dead now, so he’ll never tell.” While the answer to this specific question is likely to be lost to history, what has happened since will inevitably inform how 1984-85 is viewed. Kasparov won the rematch later that year, then beat Karpov again in each of the next three World Championships, and is now known as one of the greatest players ever. Perhaps even more crucially though, present-day Russia is using sports to promote its interests throughout the world. “I think the Russians are trying to use sports as a political weapon. I think that’s definitely true: a leopard can’t change its spots,” says Soltis. “(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is, well, a former KGB agent,” he continues. “Nowadays, with the sports boycott of the Russians, they’re in a very difficult position, and they’re trying to claw their way back into chess, and into sports in general. “(In the Soviet Union) they were using sports and chess which, of course, is considered a sport in Russia and always will be, for their own benefit. And I suspect you’re going to see this for many years to come.”\n",

      "Headline: The scent of a mummy: Research discovers ancient Egyptian remains smell nice\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/world/ancient-egyptian-remains-smell-intl-latam/index.html\n",
      "Summary: At first whiff, it sounds repulsive: sniff the essence of an ancient corpse. But researchers who indulged their curiosity in the name of science found that well-preserved Egyptian mummies actually smell pretty good. “In films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,” said Cecilia Bembibre, director of research at University College London’s Institute for Sustainable Heritage. “We were surprised at the pleasantness of them.” “Woody,” “spicy” and “sweet” were the leading descriptions from what sounded more like a wine tasting than a mummy sniffing exercise. Floral notes were also detected, which could be from pine and juniper resins used in embalming. The study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society used both chemical analysis and a panel of human sniffers to evaluate the odors from nine mummies as old as 5,000 years that had been either in storage or on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The researchers wanted to systematically study the smell of mummies because it has long been a subject of fascination for the public and researchers alike, said Bembibre, one of the report’s authors. Archeologists, historians, conservators and even fiction writers have devoted pages of their work to the subject — for good reason. Scent was an important consideration in the mummification process that used oils, waxes and balms to preserve the body and its spirit for the afterlife. The practice was largely reserved for pharaohs and nobility and pleasant smells were associated with purity and deities while bad odors were signs of corruption and decay. Without sampling the mummies themselves, which would be invasive, researchers from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia were able to measure whether aromas were coming from the archaeological item, pesticides or other products used to conserve the remains, or from deterioration due to mold, bacteria or microorganisms. “We were quite worried that we might find notes or hints of decaying bodies, which wasn’t the case,” said Matija Strlič, a chemistry professor at the University of Ljubljana. “We were specifically worried that there might be indications of microbial degradation, but that was not the case, which means that the environment in this museum, is actually quite good in terms of preservation.” Using technical instruments to measure and quantify air molecules emitted from sarcophagi to determine the state of preservation without touching the mummies was like the Holy Grail, Strlič said. “It tells us potentially what social class a mummy was from and and therefore reveals a lot of information about the mummified body that is relevant not just to conservators, but to curators and archeologists as well,” he said. “We believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections.” Barbara Huber, a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany who was not involved in the study, said the findings provide crucial data on compounds that could preserve or degrade mummified remains. The information could be used to better protect the ancient bodies for future generations. “However, the research also underscores a key challenge: the smells detected today are not necessarily those from the time of mummification,” Huber said. “Over thousands of years, evaporation, oxidation, and even storage conditions have significantly altered the original scent profile.” Huber authored a study two years ago that analyzed residue from a jar that had contained mummified organs of a noblewoman to identify embalming ingredients, their origins and what they revealed about trade routes. She then worked with a perfumer to create an interpretation of the embalming scent, known as “Scent of Eternity,” for an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark. Researchers of the current study hope to do something similar, using their findings to develop “smellscapes” to artificially recreate the scents they detected and enhance the experience for future museumgoers. “Museums have been called white cubes, where you are prompted to read, to see, to approach everything from a distance with your eyes,” Bembibre said. “Observing the mummified bodies through a glass case reduces the experience because we don’t get to smell them. We don’t get to know about the mummification process in an experiential way, which is one of the ways that we understand and engage with the world.”\n",

      "Headline: Jane Doe drops sexual assault lawsuit against Jay-Z and Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs\n",
      "Link: https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/entertainment/jay-z-sean-combs-lawsuit-dropped/index.html\n",
      "Summary: A Jane Doe who alleged Sean “Diddy” Combs and Jay-Z sexually assaulted her 25 years ago has withdrawn her lawsuit against them. In a notice of voluntary dismissal filed Friday, attorneys for the woman dropped the lawsuit with prejudice, preventing it from being re-filed in the future. “Counsel of Plaintiff have discussed this matter with counsel for each Defendant, who acknowledge and consent to this submission,” stated the court filing, signed by Doe’s attorneys. A lawyer for Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, hailed the development. “The false case against Jay-Z, that never should have been brought, has been dismissed with prejudice,” Carter’s attorney, Alex Spiro, said in a statement. “By standing up in the face of heinous and false allegations, Jay has done what few can – he pushed back, he never settled, he never paid 1 red penny, he triumphed and cleared his name.” Doe’s lawsuit was initially filed against Combs in October 2024 in which she alleged she was drugged and raped by him, along with another celebrity, at an afterparty for the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000, when she was 13 years old. In an amended complaint, filed in December 2024, Carter was added as a defendant and accused of rape. Carter vigorously denied the allegations, calling them “so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one.” Carter’s attorneys had made numerous efforts to get the case thrown out, prior to Doe dropping her lawsuit. In December, a judge denied Carter’s request to dismiss the case and granted Doe the ability to proceed anonymously, after Carter’s team had asked the judge to have her reveal her identity. At the time, the judge penned a scathing decision, condemning Carter’s attorney’s “relentless filing of combative motions” in his efforts to dismiss the case as “inappropriate.” In January, Carter’s lawyers sought again to dismiss the lawsuit and asked the judge to issue sanctions against the attorney who filed the case after several inconsistencies in Doe’s allegations were revealed. Doe acknowledged inconsistencies in her recollection of the events in an interview with NBC but stood by her allegation that she was raped. Her attorney, Tony Buzbee, told CNN at the time, “Our client remains fiercely adamant that what she has stated is true, to the best of her memory.” Combs’ attorneys told CNN that the dismissal of Doe’s case is “another confirmation that these lawsuits are built on falsehoods, not facts” and denounced “case after case filed by individuals hiding behind anonymity.” Combs, who faces more than 40 sexual assault lawsuits, was indicted in September on charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty. On Friday, Combs’ attorney told CNN he has “never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone—man or woman, adult or minor.” Doe’s attorney declined to comment.\n",
